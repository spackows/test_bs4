 Abundance of elements in Earth's crust- wikipedia Abundance of elements in Earth's crust

 Jump to: navigation, search Abundance( atom fraction) of the chemical elements in Earth's upper continental crust as a function of atomic number. The rarest elements in the crust( shown in yellow) are not the heaviest, but are rather the siderophile( iron- loving) elements in the Goldschmidt classification of elements. These have been depleted by being relocated deeper into the Earth's core. Their abundance in meteoroids is higher. Additionally, tellurium and selenium have been depleted from the crust due to formation of volatile hydrides. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust is shown in tabulated form with the estimated crustal abundance for each chemical element shown as either percentage or parts per million( ppm) by mass(10,000 ppm=1%).

`` Air'' redirects here. For other uses, see Air( disambiguation).`` Qualities of air'' redirects here. It is not to be confused with Air quality.

 Blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere, surrounding Earth in a visibly blue layer when seen from space on board the ISS at an altitude of335 km(208 mi). Composition of Earth's atmosphere by volume. Lower pie represents trace gases that together compose about0.038% of the atmosphere(0.043% with CO at2014 concentration). Numbers are mainly from1987, with CO and methane from2009, and do not represent any single source. The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's gravity. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention( greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night( the diurnal temperature variation).

 By volume, dry air contains78.09% nitrogen,20.95% oxygen,0.93% argon,0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around1% at sea level, and0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air content and atmospheric pressure vary at different layers, and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere and in artificial atmospheres.

 The atmosphere has a mass of about5.15×10 kg, three quarters of which is within about11 km(6.8 mi;36,000 ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. The Kármán line, at100 km(62 mi), or1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around120 km(75 mi). Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.

 The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science( aerology). Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.

 Main article: Atmospheric chemistry Mean atmospheric water vapor The three major constituents of Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor( a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air( without water vapor). The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases, among which are the greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine( elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide( SO) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.

 Earth's atmosphere Lower4 layers of the atmosphere in3 dimensions as seen diagonally from above the exobase. Layers drawn to scale, objects within the layers are not to scale. Aurorae shown here at the bottom of the thermosphere can actually form at any altitude in this atmospheric layer. Principal layers

 In general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions( see the temperature section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/ altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided( called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:

 Exosphere:700 to10,000 km(440 to6,200 miles) Thermosphere:80 to700 km(50 to440 miles) Mesosphere:50 to80 km(31 to50 miles) Stratosphere:12 to50 km(7 to31 miles) Troposphere:0 to12 km(0 to7 miles) Exosphere Main article: Exosphere The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere( i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about700 km above sea level, to about10,000 km(6,200 mi;33,000,000 ft) where it merges into the solar wind.

 This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free- moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind.

 The exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the aurora borealis and aurora australis sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.

 Thermosphere Main article: Thermosphere The thermosphere is the second- highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause( which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about80 km(50 mi;260,000 ft) up to the thermopause at an altitude range of500--1000 km(310--620 mi;1,600,000--3,300,000 ft). The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity. Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from80 to550 kilometres(50 to342 mi) above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.

 The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature inversion is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as1500° C(2700° F), though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule( of oxygen, for example) travels an average of1 kilometre(0.62 mi;3300 ft) between collisions with other molecules. Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.

 This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between350 and420 km(220 and260 mi).

 Mesosphere Main article: Mesosphere The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about50 km(31 mi;160,000 ft) to the mesopause at80--85 km(50--53 mi;260,000--280,000 ft) above sea level.

 Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around−85° C(−120° F;190 K).

 Just below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar- mesospheric noctilucent clouds. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around4 to16 degrees below the horizon. Lightning- induced discharges known as transient luminous events( TLEs) occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet- powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket- powered aircraft.

 Stratosphere Main article: Stratosphere The stratosphere is the second- lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly12 km(7.5 mi;39,000 ft) above Earth's surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about50 to55 km(31 to34 mi;164,000 to180,000 ft).

 The atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly1/1000 the pressure at sea level. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation( UV) radiation from the Sun by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be−60° C(−76° F;210 K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near0° C.

 The stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather- producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet- powered aircraft.

 Troposphere Main article: Troposphere The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about12 km(7.5 mi;39,000 ft), although this altitude varies from about9 km(5.6 mi;30,000 ft) at the geographic poles to17 km(11 mi;56,000 ft) at the Equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion( i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is isothermal with height.

 Although variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere( i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing( hence, the origin of its name in the Greek wordτρόπος, tropos, meaning`` turn''). The troposphere contains roughly80% of the mass of Earth's atmosphere. The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower5.6 km(3.5 mi;18,000 ft) of the troposphere.

 Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather- associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller- driven aircraft.

The orange layer is the troposphere, which gives way to the whitish stratosphere and then the blue mesosphere. Other layers

 Within the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:

 The ozone layer is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer ozone concentrations are about2 to8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about15--35 km(9.3--21.7 mi;49,000--115,000 ft), though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere. The ionosphere is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. It is responsible for auroras. During daytime hours, it stretches from50 to1,000 km(31 to621 mi;160,000 to3,280,000 ft) and includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere. However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere. The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere. It has practical importance because it influences, for example, radio propagation on Earth. The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface- based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence. This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the turbopause found at about100 km(62 mi;330,000 ft), the very edge of space itself as accepted by the FAI, which places it about20 km(12 mi;66,000 ft) above the mesopause. Above this altitude lies the heterosphere, which includes the exosphere and most of the thermosphere. Here, the chemical composition varies with altitude. This is because the distance that particles can move without colliding with one another is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only near the bottom of the heterosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element. The planetary boundary layer is the part of the troposphere that is closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through turbulent diffusion. During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well- mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about100 metres(330 ft) on clear, calm nights to3,000 m(9,800 ft) or more during the afternoon in dry regions. The average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is14° C(57° F;287 K) or15° C(59° F;288 K), depending on the reference.

 Physical properties

 Comparison of the1962 US Standard Atmosphere graph of geometric altitude against air density, pressure, the speed of sound and temperature with approximate altitudes of various objects. Pressure and thickness

 Main article: Atmospheric pressure The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International Standard Atmosphere as101325 pascals(760.00 Torr;14.6959 psi;760.00 mmHg). This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres( atm). Total atmospheric mass is5.1480×10 kg(1.135×10 lb), about2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and weather.

 If the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of8.50 km(27,900 ft). It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every5.6 km(18,000 ft) or by a factor of1/ e every7.64 km(25,100 ft), the average scale height of the atmosphere below70 km(43 mi;230,000 ft). However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.

 In summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:

50% is below5.6 km(18,000 ft).90% is below16 km(52,000 ft).99.99997% is below100 km(62 mi;330,000 ft), the Kármán line. By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered astronauts. By comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at8,848 m(29,029 ft); commercial airliners typically cruise between10 and13 km(33,000 and43,000 ft) where the thinner air improves fuel economy; weather balloons reach30.4 km(100,000 ft) and above; and the highest X-15 flight in1963 reached108.0 km(354,300 ft).

 Even above the Kármán line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur. Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below100 km and extend beyond500 km. By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at350--400 km, within the F- layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as700--800 km.

 Temperature and speed of sound

 Main articles: Atmospheric temperature and Speed of sound Temperature trends in two thick layers of the atmosphere as measured between January1979 and December2005 by Microwave Sounding Units and Advanced Microwave Sounding Units on NOAA weather satellites. The instruments record microwaves emitted from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. Source: The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above11 km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the stratosphere, starting above about20 km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly- named thermosphere above90 km.

 Because in an ideal gas of constant composition the speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile( see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.

 Density and mass

 Temperature and mass density against altitude from the NRLMSISE-00 standard atmosphere model( the eight dotted lines in each`` decade'' are at the eight cubes8,27,64,...,729) Main article: Density of air The density of air at sea level is about1.2 kg/ m(1.2 g/ L,0.0012 g/ cm). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air( a form of the ideal gas law). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.

 The average mass of the atmosphere is about5 quadrillion(5×10) tonnes or1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research,`` The total mean mass of the atmosphere is5.1480×10 kg with an annual range due to water vapor of1.2 or1.5×10 kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as1.27×10 kg and the dry air mass as5.1352±0.0003×10 kg.''

Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we can not see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.

 Scattering

 Main article: Scattering When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you can not see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter( blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer( red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.

 Absorption

 Main article: Absorption( electromagnetic radiation) Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric transmittance( or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light. Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O and O absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than300 nanometers. Water( H O) absorbs many wavelengths above700 nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.

 The combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave`` windows'' of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The optical window runs from around300 nm( ultraviolet- C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum( commonly called light), at roughly400--700 nm and continues to the infrared to around1100 nm. There are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven- meter waves.

 Emission

 Main article: Emission( electromagnetic radiation) Emission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their`` black body'' emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately6,000 K(5,730° C;10,340° F), its radiation peaks near500 nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately290 K(17° C;62° F), so its radiation peaks near10,000 nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.

 Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds( H O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.

 The greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are CO and H O.

 Refractive index

 See also: Scintillation( astronomy) The refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth's surface.

 The refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the mirage.

 Circulation

 Main article: Atmospheric circulation An idealised view of three large circulation cells. Atmospheric circulation is the large- scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means( with ocean circulation) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large- scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.

 Evolution of Earth's atmosphere

 See also: History of Earth and Paleoclimatology Earliest atmosphere

 The first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants( Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia.

 Second atmosphere

 Outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases. A major part of carbon- dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments. Water- related sediments have been found that date from as early as3.8 billion years ago.

 About3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable`` second atmosphere''. The influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life- forms appear as early as3.5 billion years ago. How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the`` faint young Sun paradox''.

 The geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth-- with the exception of one cold glacial phase about2.4 billion years ago. In the late Archean Eon an oxygen- containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing cyanobacteria( see Great Oxygenation Event), which have been found as stromatolite fossils from2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy( isotope ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as4 billion years ago.

 Ancient sediments in the Gabon dating from between about2,150 and2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion.

 Third atmosphere

 Oxygen content of the atmosphere over the last billion years The constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long- term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations.

 Before this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen. This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere. O showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than15% by the end of the Precambrian. The following time span from541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon, during the earliest period of which, the Cambrian, oxygen- requiring metazoan life forms began to appear.

 The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last600 million years, reaching a peak of about30% around280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen. Breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains21% oxygen, which is great enough for this rapid development of animals.

 Air pollution

 Main article: Air pollution Air pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms. Stratospheric ozone depletion is caused by air pollution, chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone- depleting substances.

 The scientific consensus is that the anthropogenic greenhouse gases currently accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of global warming.

Following the peak in vegetation, the drawdown of atmospheric CO due to photosynthesis is apparent, particularly over the boreal forests. Images from space

 On October19,2015 NASA started a website containing daily images of the full sunlit side of Earth on http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/. The images are taken from the Deep Space Climate Observatory( DSCOVR) and show Earth as it rotates during a day.

 Blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere, giving Earth a blue halo when seen from space. The geomagnetic storms cause beautiful displays of aurora across the atmosphere. Limb view, of Earth's atmosphere. Colors roughly denote the layers of the atmosphere. This image shows the Moon at the centre, with the limb of Earth near the bottom transitioning into the orange- colored troposphere. The troposphere ends abruptly at the tropopause, which appears in the image as the sharp boundary between the orange- and blue- colored atmosphere. The silvery- blue noctilucent clouds extend far above Earth's troposphere. Earth's atmosphere backlit by the Sun in an eclipse observed from deep space onboard Apollo12 in1969. See also

 Jump to: navigation, search This article is about the astronomical concept. For precession of the axes outside of astronomy, see Precession. For other types of astronomical precession, see Precession§ Astronomy. Precessional movement of Earth. Earth rotates( white arrows) once a day around its rotational axis( red); this axis itself rotates slowly( white circle), completing a rotation in approximately26,000 years In astronomy, axial precession is a gravity- induced, slow, and continuous change in the orientation of an astronomical body's rotational axis. In particular, it can refer to the gradual shift in the orientation of Earth's axis of rotation, which, similar to a wobbling top, traces out a pair of cones joined at their apices in a cycle of approximately26,000 years. The term`` precession'' typically refers only to this largest part of the motion; other changes in the alignment of Earth's axis-- nutation and polar motion-- are much smaller in magnitude.

 Earth's precession was historically called the precession of the equinoxes, because the equinoxes moved westward along the ecliptic relative to the fixed stars, opposite to the yearly motion of the Sun along the ecliptic. This term is still used in non-technical discussions, that is, when detailed mathematics are absent. Historically, the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes is usually attributed in the west to the Hellenistic- era( second- century BCE) astronomer, Hipparchus, although there are claims of its earlier discovery, such as in the Indian text, Vedanga Jyotisha, dating from700 BC. With improvements in the ability to calculate the gravitational force between and among planets during the first half of the nineteenth century, it was recognized that the ecliptic itself moved slightly, which was named planetary precession, as early as1863, while the dominant component was named lunisolar precession. Their combination was named general precession, instead of precession of the equinoxes.

 Lunisolar precession is caused by the gravitational forces of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge, causing Earth's axis to move with respect to inertial space. Planetary precession( an advance) is due to the small angle between the gravitational force of the other planets on Earth and its orbital plane( the ecliptic), causing the plane of the ecliptic to shift slightly relative to inertial space. Lunisolar precession is about500 times greater than planetary precession. In addition to the Moon and Sun, the other planets also cause a small movement of Earth's axis in inertial space, making the contrast in the terms lunisolar versus planetary misleading, so in2006 the International Astronomical Union recommended that the dominant component be renamed the precession of the equator, and the minor component be renamed precession of the ecliptic, but their combination is still named general precession. Many references to the old terms exist in publications predating the change.

 Precession nomenclature( edit)

 Etymologically,`` precession'' and`` procession'' are both terms that relate to motion.`` Precession'' is derived from the Latin praecedere,`` to precede, to come before or earlier''), while`` procession'' is derived from the Latin procedere,`` to march forward, to advance''). Generally the term`` procession'' is used to describe a group of objects moving forward. The stars viewed from Earth are seen to proceed in a procession from east to west daily, due to the Earth's diurnal motion, and yearly, due to the Earth's revolution around the Sun. At the same time the stars can be observed to anticipate slightly such motion, at the rate of approximately50 arc seconds per year, a phenomenon known as the`` precession of the equinoxes''.

 In describing this motion astronomers generally have shortened the term to simply`` precession''. In describing the cause of the motion physicists have also used the term`` precession'', which has led to some confusion between the observable phenomenon and its cause, which matters because in astronomy, some precessions are real and others are apparent. This issue is further obfuscated by the fact that many astronomers are physicists or astrophysicists.

 It should be noted that the term`` precession'' used in astronomy generally describes the observable precession of the equinox( the stars moving retrograde across the sky), whereas the term`` precession'' as used in physics, generally describes a mechanical process.

 Effects( edit)

 The coincidence of the annual cycles of the apses( closest and further approach to the sun) and calendar dates( with seasons noted) at four equally spaced stages of precessionary26,000- year- cycle. The season dates are those in the north. The tilt of Earth's axis and the eccentricity of its orbit are exaggerated. Approximate estimates. Effects of weak planetary precession on the stages shown are ignored. The precession of the Earth's axis has a number of observable effects. First, the positions of the south and north celestial poles appear to move in circles against the space- fixed backdrop of stars, completing one circuit in approximately26,000 years. Thus, while today the star Polaris lies approximately at the north celestial pole, this will change over time, and other stars will become the`` north star''. In approximately3200 years, the star Gamma Cephei in the Cepheus constellation will succeed Polaris for this position. The south celestial pole currently lacks a bright star to mark its position, but over time precession also will cause bright stars to become south stars. As the celestial poles shift, there is a corresponding gradual shift in the apparent orientation of the whole star field, as viewed from a particular position on Earth.

 Secondly, the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun at the solstices, equinoxes, or other time defined relative to the seasons, slowly changes. For example, suppose that the Earth's orbital position is marked at the summer solstice, when the Earth's axial tilt is pointing directly toward the Sun. One full orbit later, when the Sun has returned to the same apparent position relative to the background stars, the Earth's axial tilt is not now directly toward the Sun: because of the effects of precession, it is a little way`` beyond'' this. In other words, the solstice occurred a little earlier in the orbit. Thus, the tropical year, measuring the cycle of seasons( for example, the time from solstice to solstice, or equinox to equinox), is about20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year, which is measured by the Sun's apparent position relative to the stars. After about26000 years the difference amounts to a full year, so the positions of the seasons relative to the orbit are`` back where they started''.( Other effects also slowly change the shape and orientation of the Earth's orbit, and these, in combination with precession, create various cycles of differing periods; see also Milankovitch cycles. The magnitude of the Earth's tilt, as opposed to merely its orientation, also changes slowly over time, but this effect is not attributed directly to precession.)

 For identical reasons, the apparent position of the Sun relative to the backdrop of the stars at some seasonally fixed time slowly regresses a full360° through all twelve traditional constellations of the zodiac, at the rate of about50.3 seconds of arc per year, or1 degree every71.6 years.

 At present, the rate of precession corresponds to a period of25,772 years, but the rate itself varies somewhat with time( see Values below), so one can not say that in exactly25,772 years the earth's axis will be back to where it is now.

 For further details, see Changing pole stars and Polar shift and equinoxes shift, below.

 History( edit)

 Hellenistic World( edit)

 Hipparchus( edit) Though there is still- controversial evidence that Aristarchus of Samos possessed distinct values for the sidereal and tropical years as early as c.280 BC, the discovery of precession usually is attributed to Hipparchus(190--120 BC) of Rhodes or Nicaea, a Greek astronomer. According to Ptolemy's Almagest, Hipparchus measured the longitude of Spica and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, Timocharis(320--260 BC) and Aristillus(~280 BC), he concluded that Spica had moved2° relative to the autumnal equinox. He also compared the lengths of the tropical year( the time it takes the Sun to return to an equinox) and the sidereal year( the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving(`` precessing'') through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than1° in a century, in other words, completing a full cycle in no more than36000 years.

 Virtually all of the writings of Hipparchus are lost, including his work on precession. They are mentioned by Ptolemy, who explains precession as the rotation of the celestial sphere around a motionless Earth. It is reasonable to presume that Hipparchus, similarly to Ptolemy, thought of precession in geocentric terms as a motion of the heavens, rather than of the Earth.

 Ptolemy( edit) The first astronomer known to have continued Hipparchus's work on precession is Ptolemy in the second century AD. Ptolemy measured the longitudes of Regulus, Spica, and other bright stars with a variation of Hipparchus's lunar method that did not require eclipses. Before sunset, he measured the longitudinal arc separating the Moon from the Sun. Then, after sunset, he measured the arc from the Moon to the star. He used Hipparchus's model to calculate the Sun's longitude, and made corrections for the Moon's motion and its parallax( Evans1998, pp.251--255). Ptolemy compared his own observations with those made by Hipparchus, Menelaus of Alexandria, Timocharis, and Agrippa. He found that between Hipparchus's time and his own( about265 years), the stars had moved2°40', or1° in100 years(36'' per year; the rate accepted today is about50'' per year or1° in72 years). He also confirmed that precession affected all fixed stars, not just those near the ecliptic, and his cycle had the same period of36,000 years as found by Hipparchus.

 Other authors( edit) Most ancient authors did not mention precession and, perhaps, did not know of it. For instance, Proclus rejected precession, while Theon of Alexandria, a commentator on Ptolemy in the fourth century, accepted Ptolemy's explanation. Theon also reports an alternate theory:

 According to certain opinions ancient astrologers believe that from a certain epoch the solstitial signs have a motion of8° in the order of the signs, after which they go back the same amount...( Dreyer1958, p.204) Instead of proceeding through the entire sequence of the zodiac, the equinoxes`` trepidated'' back and forth over an arc of8°. The theory of trepidation is presented by Theon as an alternative to precession.

 Alternative discovery theories( edit)

 Babylonians( edit) Various assertions have been made that other cultures discovered precession independently of Hipparchus. According to Al- Battani, the Chaldean astronomers had distinguished the tropical and sidereal year so that by approximately330 BC, they would have been in a position to describe precession, if inaccurately, but such claims generally are regarded as unsupported.

 Maya( edit) The archaeologist Susan Milbrath has speculated that the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar of``30,000 years involving the Pleiades... may have been an effort to calculate the precession of the equinox.'' This view is held by few other professional scholars of Mayan civilization.

 Ancient Egyptians( edit) Similar claims have been made that precession was known in Ancient Egypt during the dynastic era, prior to the time of Hipparchus( Ptolemaic period). However, these claims remain controversial. Some buildings in the Karnak temple complex, for instance, allegedly were oriented toward the point on the horizon where certain stars rose or set at key times of the year. Nonetheless, they kept accurate calendars and if they recorded the date of the temple reconstructions it would be a fairly simple matter to plot the rough precession rate. The Dendera Zodiac, a star- map from the Hathor temple at Dendera from a late( Ptolemaic) age, allegedly records precession of the equinoxes( Tompkins1971). In any case, if the ancient Egyptians knew of precession, their knowledge is not recorded as such in any of their surviving astronomical texts.

 Michael Rice wrote in his Egypt's Legacy,`` Whether or not the ancients knew of the mechanics of the Precession before its definition by Hipparchos the Bithynian in the second century BC is uncertain, but as dedicated watchers of the night sky they could not fail to be aware of its effects.''( p.128) Rice believes that`` the Precession is fundamental to an understanding of what powered the development of Egypt''( p.10), to the extent that`` in a sense Egypt as a nation- state and the king of Egypt as a living god are the products of the realisation by the Egyptians of the astronomical changes effected by the immense apparent movement of the heavenly bodies which the Precession implies.''( p.56). Rice says that`` the evidence that the most refined astronomical observation was practised in Egypt in the third millennium BC( and probably even before that date) is clear from the precision with which the Pyramids at Giza are aligned to the cardinal points, a precision which could only have been achieved by their alignment with the stars.''( p.31) The Egyptians also, says Rice, were`` to alter the orientation of a temple when the star on whose position it had originally been set moved its position as a consequence of the Precession, something which seems to have happened several times during the New Kingdom.''( p.170)

 Indian views( edit)

 Main article: Ayanamsa Indian astrologers were aware of axial precession since before the Common Era. Although many of the astronomical texts stored in Taxila were burnt during Muslim invasion of India, the classic astronomical text Suryasiddhanta survived and contains references about ayana movements. In a later commentary on Suryasiddhanta around twelfth century, Bhāskara II says:`` sampāt revolves negatively30000 times in a Kalpa of4320 million years according to Suryasiddhanta, while Munjāla and others say ayana moves forward199669 in a Kalpa, and one should combine the two, before ascertaining declension, ascensional difference, etc.'' Lancelot Wilkinson translated the last of these three verses in a too concise manner to convey the full meaning, and skipped the portion combine the two which the modern Hindu commentary has brought to the fore. According to the Hindu commentary, the final value of period of precession should be obtained by combining+199669 revolutions of ayana with−30000 revolutions of sampaat, to get+169669 per Kalpa, i.e. one revolution in25461 years, which is near the modern value of25771 years.

 Moreover, Munjāla's value gives a period of21636 years for ayana's motion, which is the modern value of precession when anomalistic precession also is taken into account. The latter has a period of136000 years now, but Bhāskar- II gives its value at144000 years(30000 in a Kalpa), calling it sampāt. Bhāskar- II did not give any name of the final term after combining the negative sampāt with the positive ayana. The value he gave indicates, however, that by ayana he meant precession on account of the combined influence of orbital and anomalistic precessions, and by sampāt he meant the anomalistic period, but defined it as equinox. His language is a bit confused, which he clarified in his own Vāsanābhāshya commentary Siddhānta Shiromani, by saying that Suryasiddhanta was not available and he was writing on the basis of hearsay. Bhāskar- II did not give his own opinion, he merely cited Suryasiddhanta, Munjāla, and unnamed`` others''.

 Extant Suryasiddhanta supports the notion of trepidation within a range of±27° at the rate of54'' per year according to traditional commentators, but Burgess opined that the original meaning must have been of a cyclical motion, for which he quoted the Suryasiddhanta mentioned by Bhāskar II.

 Chinese Astronomy( edit)

 Yu Xi( fourth century AD) was the first Chinese astronomer to mention precession. He estimated the rate of precession as1° in50 years( Pannekoek1961, p.92).

 Middle Ages and renaissance( edit)

 In medieval Islamic astronomy, precession was known based on Ptolemy's Almagest, and by observations that refined the value.

 Al- Battani, in his Zij Al- Sabi', after mentioning Hipparchus calculating precession, and Ptolemy's value of1 degree per100 solar years, says that he measured precession and found it to be on degree per66 solar years.

 Subsequently, Al- Sufi mentions the same values in his Book of Fixed Stars, that Ptolemy's value for precession is1 degree per100 solar years. He then quotes a different value from Zij Al Mumtahan, which was done during Al- Ma'mun's reign, as1 degree for every66 solar years. He also quotes the aforementioned Al- Battani's Zij Al- Sabi' as adjusting coordinates for stars by11 degrees and10 minutes of arc to account for the difference between Al- Battani's time and Ptolemy's.

 Later, the Zij- i Ilkhani compiled at the Maragheh observatory sets the precession of the equinoxes at51 arc seconds per annum, which is very close to the modern value of50.2 arc seconds.

 In the Middle Ages, Islamic and Latin Christian astronomers treated`` trepidation'' as a motion of the fixed stars to be added to precession. This theory is commonly attributed to the Arab astronomer Thabit ibn Qurra, but the attribution has been contested in modern times. Nicolaus Copernicus published a different account of trepidation in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium(1543). This work makes the first definite reference to precession as the result of a motion of the Earth's axis. Copernicus characterized precession as the third motion of the Earth.

 Modern period( edit)

 Over a century later precession was explained in Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica(1687), to be a consequence of gravitation( Evans1998, p.246). Newton's original precession equations did not work, however, and were revised considerably by Jean le Rond d'Alembert and subsequent scientists.

 Hipparchus's discovery( edit)

 Hipparchus gave an account of his discovery in On the Displacement of the Solsticial and Equinoctial Points( described in Almagest III.1 and VII.2). He measured the ecliptic longitude of the star Spica during lunar eclipses and found that it was about6° west of the autumnal equinox. By comparing his own measurements with those of Timocharis of Alexandria( a contemporary of Euclid, who worked with Aristillus early in the3rd century BC), he found that Spica's longitude had decreased by about2° in the meantime( exact years are not mentioned in Almagest). Also in VII.2, Ptolemy gives more precise observations of two stars, including Spica and concludes that in each case a2°:40' change occurred during128 BC and AD139( hence,1° per century or one full cycle in36000 years, that is, the precessional period of Hipparchus as reported by Ptolemy; cf. page328 in Toomer's translation of Almagest,1998 edition)). He also noticed this motion in other stars. He speculated that only the stars near the zodiac shifted over time. Ptolemy called this his`` first hypothesis''( Almagest VII.1), but did not report any later hypothesis Hipparchus might have devised. Hipparchus apparently limited his speculations, because he had only a few older observations, which were not very reliable.

 Why did Hipparchus need a lunar eclipse to measure the position of a star? The equinoctial points are not marked in the sky, so he needed the Moon as a reference point. Hipparchus already had developed a way to calculate the longitude of the Sun at any moment. A lunar eclipse happens during Full moon, when the Moon is in opposition. At the midpoint of the eclipse, the Moon is precisely180° from the Sun. Hipparchus is thought to have measured the longitudinal arc separating Spica from the Moon. To this value, he added the calculated longitude of the Sun, plus180° for the longitude of the Moon. He did the same procedure with Timocharis' data( Evans1998, p.251). Observations such as these eclipses, incidentally, are the main source of data about when Hipparchus worked, since other biographical information about him is minimal. The lunar eclipses he observed, for instance, took place on April21,146 BC, and March21,135 BC( Toomer1984, p.135 n.14).

 Hipparchus also studied precession in On the Length of the Year. Two kinds of year are relevant to understanding his work. The tropical year is the length of time that the Sun, as viewed from the Earth, takes to return to the same position along the ecliptic( its path among the stars on the celestial sphere). The sidereal year is the length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position with respect to the stars of the celestial sphere. Precession causes the stars to change their longitude slightly each year, so the sidereal year is longer than the tropical year. Using observations of the equinoxes and solstices, Hipparchus found that the length of the tropical year was365+1/4−1/300 days, or365.24667 days( Evans1998, p.209). Comparing this with the length of the sidereal year, he calculated that the rate of precession was not less than1° in a century. From this information, it is possible to calculate that his value for the sidereal year was365+1/4+1/144 days( Toomer1978, p.218). By giving a minimum rate he may have been allowing for errors in observation.

 To approximate his tropical year Hipparchus created his own lunisolar calendar by modifying those of Meton and Callippus in On Intercalary Months and Days( now lost), as described by Ptolemy in the Almagest III.1( Toomer1984, p.139). The Babylonian calendar used a cycle of235 lunar months in19 years since499 BC( with only three exceptions before380 BC), but it did not use a specified number of days. The Metonic cycle(432 BC) assigned6,940 days to these19 years producing an average year of365+1/4+1/76 or365.26316 days. The Callippic cycle(330 BC) dropped one day from four Metonic cycles(76 years) for an average year of365+1/4 or365.25 days. Hipparchus dropped one more day from four Callippic cycles(304 years), creating the Hipparchic cycle with an average year of365+1/4−1/304 or365.24671 days, which was close to his tropical year of365+1/4−1/300 or365.24667 days.

 We find Hipparchus's mathematical signatures in the Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient astronomical computer of the second century BC. The mechanism is based on a solar year, the Metonic Cycle, which is the period the Moon reappears in the same star in the sky with the same phase( full Moon appears at the same position in the sky approximately in19 years), the Callipic cycle( which is four Metonic cycles and more accurate), the Saros cycle and the Exeligmos cycles( three Saros cycles for the accurate eclipse prediction). The study of the Antikythera Mechanism proves that the ancients have been using very accurate calendars based on all the aspects of solar and lunar motion in the sky. In fact, the Lunar Mechanism which is part of the Antikythera Mechanism depicts the motion of the Moon and its phase, for a given time, using a train of four gears with a pin and slot device which gives a variable lunar velocity that is very close to the second law of Kepler, i.e. it takes into account the fast motion of the Moon at perigee and slower motion at apogee. This discovery proves that Hipparchus mathematics were much more advanced than Ptolemy describes in his books, as it is evident that he developed a good approximation of Kepler ́ s second law.

 Mithraic question( edit)

 This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.( September2017)( Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Mithraic Mysteries, colloquially also known as Mithraism, was a1st--4th century neo-platonic mystery cult of the Roman god Mithras. The near- total lack of written descriptions or scripture necessitates a reconstruction of beliefs and practices from the archaeological evidence, such as that found in Mithraic temples( in modern times called mithraea), which were real or artificial`` caves'' representing the cosmos. Until the1970s most scholars followed Franz Cumont in identifying Mithras as a continuation of the Persian god Mithra. Cumont's continuity hypothesis, and his concomitant theory that the astrological component was a late and unimportant accretion, is no longer followed. Today, the cult and its beliefs are recognized as a product of( Greco-) Roman thought, with an astrological component even more heavily pronounced than the already very astrology- centric Roman beliefs generally were. The details, however, are debated.

 As far as axial precession is concerned, one scholar of Mithraism, David Ulansey, has interpreted Mithras as a personification of the force responsible for precession( Ulansey,1989). He argues that the cult was a religious response to Hipparchus's discovery of precession, which-- from the ancient geocentric perspective-- amounted to the discovery that the entire cosmos( i.e., the outermost celestial sphere of the fixed stars) was moving in a previously unknown way. His analysis is based on the so- called`` tauroctony'': the image of Mithras killing a bull that was located in the central place in every Mithraic temple. In the standard tauroctony, Mithras and the bull are accompanied by a dog, a snake, a raven, and a scorpion. According to Ulansey, the tauroctony is a star chart. The bull is Taurus, a constellation of the zodiac. In the astrological age that preceded the time of Hipparchus, the vernal equinox had taken place when the Sun was in the constellation of Taurus, and during that previous epoch the constellations of Canis Minor( The Dog), Hydra( The Snake), Corvus( The Raven), and Scorpius( The Scorpion)-- i.e., the constellations that correspond to the animals depicted in the tauroctony-- all lay on the celestial equator( the location of which is shifted by the precession) and thus had privileged positions in the sky during that epoch. Mithras himself represents the constellation Perseus, which is located directly above Taurus the Bull: the same location occupied by Mithras in the tauroctony image. Mithras' killing of the Bull, by this reasoning, represented the power possessed by this new god to shift the entire cosmic structure, turning the cosmic sphere so that the location of the spring equinox left the constellation of Taurus( a transition symbolized by the killing of the Bull), and the Dog, Snake, Raven, and Scorpion likewise lost their privileged positions on the celestial equator.

 The iconography also contains two torch- bearing twins( Cautes and Cautopates) framing the bull- slaying image-- one holding a torch pointing up and the other a torch pointing down. These torch- bearers are sometimes depicted with one of them( torch up) holding or associated with a Bull and a tree with leaves, and the other( torch down) holding or associated with a Scorpion and a tree with fruit. Ulansey interprets these torch- bearers as representing the spring equinox( torch up, tree with leaves, Bull) and the autumm equinox( torch down, tree with fruit, Scorpion) in Taurus and Scorpius respectively, which is where the equinoxes were located during the preceding`` Age of Taurus'' symbolized in the tauroctony as a whole. Thus Ulansey concludes that Mithraic iconography was an`` astronomical code'' whose secret was the existence of a new cosmic divinity, unknown to those outside the cult, whose fundamental attribute was his ability to shift the structure of the entire cosmos and thereby to control the astrological forces believed at that time to determine human existence, thus giving him the power to grant his devotees success during life and salvation after death( i.e., a safe journey through the planetary spheres and a subsequent immortal existence in the realm of the stars).

 Changing pole stars( edit)

 Precession of Earth's axis around the north ecliptical pole A consequence of the precession is a changing pole star. Currently Polaris is extremely well suited to mark the position of the north celestial pole, as Polaris is a moderately bright star with a visual magnitude of2.1( variable), and it is located about one degree from the pole.

 The previous pole star was Kochab( Beta Ursae Minoris,β UMi,β Ursae Minoris), the brightest star in the bowl of the`` Little Dipper'', located16 degrees from Polaris. It held that role from1500 BC to AD500. It was not quite as accurate in its day as Polaris is today. Today, Kochab and its neighbor Pherkad are referred to as the`` Guardians of the Pole''( meaning Polaris).

 On the other hand, Thuban in the constellation Draco, which was the pole star in3000 BC, is much less conspicuous at magnitude3.67( one- fifth as bright as Polaris); today it is invisible in light- polluted urban skies.

 The brilliant Vega in the constellation Lyra is often touted as the best north star( it fulfilled that role around12,000 BC and will do so again around the year14,000); however, it never comes closer than5° to the pole.

 When Polaris becomes the north star again around27,800, due to its proper motion it then will be farther away from the pole than it is now, while in23,600 BC it came closer to the pole.

 Precession of Earth's axis around the south ecliptical pole It is more difficult to find the south celestial pole in the sky at this moment, as that area is a particularly bland portion of the sky, and the nominal south pole star is Sigma Octantis, which with magnitude5.5 is barely visible to the naked eye even under ideal conditions. That will change from the80th to the90th centuries, however, when the south celestial pole travels through the False Cross.

 This situation also is seen on a star map. The orientation of the south pole is moving toward the Southern Cross constellation. For the last2,000 years or so, the Southern Cross has pointed to the south celestial pole. As a consequence, the constellation is no longer visible from subtropical northern latitudes, as it was in the time of the ancient Greeks.

 Polar shift and equinoxes shift( edit)

 Precessional movement as seen from' outside' the celestial sphere The26,000- year cycle of precession as seen from near the Earth. The current north pole star is Polaris( top). In about8,000 years it will be the bright star Deneb( left), and in about12,000 years, Vega( left center). The Earth's rotation is not depicted to scale-- in this span of time, it should rotate over9 million times. The images above attempt to explain the relation between the precession of the Earth's axis and the shift in the equinoxes. These images show the position of the Earth's axis on the celestial sphere, a fictitious sphere which places the stars according to their position as seen from Earth, regardless of their actual distance. The first image shows the celestial sphere from the outside, with the constellations in mirror image. The second image shows the perspective of a near- Earth position as seen through a very wide angle lens( from which the apparent distortion arises).

 The rotation axis of the Earth describes, over a period of25,700 years, a small circle( blue) among the stars, centered on the ecliptic north pole( the blue E) and with an angular radius of about23.4°, an angle known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. The direction of precession is opposite to the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis. The orange axis was the Earth's rotation axis5,000 years ago, when it pointed to the star Thuban. The yellow axis, pointing to Polaris, marks the axis now.

 The equinoxes occur where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic( red line), that is, where the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the Sun and Earth.( Note that the term`` equinox'' here refers to a point on the celestial sphere so defined, rather than the moment in time when the Sun is overhead at the Equator, though the two meanings are related.) When the axis precesses from one orientation to another, the equatorial plane of the Earth( indicated by the circular grid around the equator) moves. The celestial equator is just the Earth's equator projected onto the celestial sphere, so it moves as the Earth's equatorial plane moves, and the intersection with the ecliptic moves with it. The positions of the poles and equator on Earth do not change, only the orientation of the Earth against the fixed stars.

 As seen from the orange grid,5,000 years ago, the vernal equinox was close to the star Aldebaran of Taurus. Now, as seen from the yellow grid, it has shifted( indicated by the red arrow) to somewhere in the constellation of Pisces.

 Still pictures like these are only first approximations, as they do not take into account the variable speed of the precession, the variable obliquity of the ecliptic, the planetary precession( which is a slow rotation of the ecliptic plane itself, presently around an axis located on the plane, with longitude174°.8764) and the proper motions of the stars.

 The precession of the equinoxes is caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and the Moon, and to a lesser extent other bodies, on the Earth. It was first explained by Sir Isaac Newton.

 Axial precession is similar to the precession of a spinning top. In both cases, the applied force is due to gravity. For a spinning top, this force tends to be almost parallel to the rotation axis. For the Earth, however, the applied forces of the Sun and the Moon are nearly perpendicular to the axis of rotation.

 The Earth is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid, with an equatorial diameter about43 kilometers larger than its polar diameter. Because of the Earth's axial tilt, during most of the year the half of this bulge that is closest to the Sun is off- center, either to the north or to the south, and the far half is off- center on the opposite side. The gravitational pull on the closer half is stronger, since gravity decreases with distance, so this creates a small torque on the Earth as the Sun pulls harder on one side of the Earth than the other. The axis of this torque is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the Earth's rotation so the axis of rotation precesses. If the Earth were a perfect sphere, there would be no precession.

 This average torque is perpendicular to the direction in which the rotation axis is tilted away from the ecliptic pole, so that it does not change the axial tilt itself. The magnitude of the torque from the Sun( or the Moon) varies with the gravitational object's alignment with the Earth's spin axis and approaches zero when it is orthogonal.

 Although the above explanation involved the Sun, the same explanation holds true for any object moving around the Earth, along or close to the ecliptic, notably, the Moon. The combined action of the Sun and the Moon is called the lunisolar precession. In addition to the steady progressive motion( resulting in a full circle in about25,700 years) the Sun and Moon also cause small periodic variations, due to their changing positions. These oscillations, in both precessional speed and axial tilt, are known as the nutation. The most important term has a period of18.6 years and an amplitude of9.2''.

 In addition to lunisolar precession, the actions of the other planets of the Solar System cause the whole ecliptic to rotate slowly around an axis which has an ecliptic longitude of about174° measured on the instantaneous ecliptic. This so- called planetary precession shift amounts to a rotation of the ecliptic plane of0.47 seconds of arc per year( more than a hundred times smaller than lunisolar precession). The sum of the two precessions is known as the general precession.

 Equations( edit)

 Tidal force on Earth due to the Sun, Moon, or a planet The tidal force on Earth due to a perturbing body( Sun, Moon or planet) is expressed by Newton's law of universal gravitation, whereby the gravitational force of the perturbing body on the side of Earth nearest is said to be greater than the gravitational force on the far side by an amount proportional to the difference in the cubes of the distances between the near and far sides. If the gravitational force of the perturbing body acting on the mass of the Earth as a point mass at the center of Earth( which provides the centripetal force causing the orbital motion) is subtracted from the gravitational force of the perturbing body everywhere on the surface of Earth, what remains may be regarded as the tidal force. This gives the paradoxical notion of a force acting away from the satellite but in reality it is simply a lesser force towards that body due to the gradient in the gravitational field. For precession, this tidal force can be grouped into two forces which only act on the equatorial bulge outside of a mean spherical radius. This couple can be decomposed into two pairs of components, one pair parallel to Earth's equatorial plane toward and away from the perturbing body which cancel each other out, and another pair parallel to Earth's rotational axis, both toward the ecliptic plane. The latter pair of forces creates the following torque vector on Earth's equatorial bulge:

 T→=3 G m r3( C− A) sin⁡δ cos⁡δ( sin⁡α− cos⁡α0)(\ displaystyle(\ overrightarrow( T))=(\ frac(3Gm)( r^(3)))( C-A)\ sin\ delta\ cos\ delta(\ begin( pmatrix)\ sin\ alpha\\-\ cos\ alpha\\0\ end( pmatrix))) where

 Gm= standard gravitational parameter of the perturbing body r= geocentric distance to the perturbing body C= moment of inertia around Earth's axis of rotation A= moment of inertia around any equatorial diameter of Earth C− A= moment of inertia of Earth's equatorial bulge( C> A)δ= declination of the perturbing body( north or south of equator)α= right ascension of the perturbing body( east from vernal equinox). The three unit vectors of the torque at the center of the Earth( top to bottom) are x on a line within the ecliptic plane( the intersection of Earth's equatorial plane with the ecliptic plane) directed toward the vernal equinox, y on a line in the ecliptic plane directed toward the summer solstice(90° east of x), and z on a line directed toward the north pole of the ecliptic.

 The value of the three sinusoidal terms in the direction of x( sinδ cosδ sinα) for the Sun is a sine squared waveform varying from zero at the equinoxes(0°,180°) to0.36495 at the solstices(90°,270°). The value in the direction of y( sinδ cosδ(− cosα)) for the Sun is a sine wave varying from zero at the four equinoxes and solstices to±0.19364( slightly more than half of the sine squared peak) halfway between each equinox and solstice with peaks slightly skewed toward the equinoxes(43.37°(−),136.63°(+),223.37°(−),316.63°(+)). Both solar waveforms have about the same peak- to- peak amplitude and the same period, half of a revolution or half of a year. The value in the direction of z is zero.

 The average torque of the sine wave in the direction of y is zero for the Sun or Moon, so this component of the torque does not affect precession. The average torque of the sine squared waveform in the direction of x for the Sun or Moon is:

 T x=32 G m a3(1− e2)3/2( C− A) sin⁡ε cos⁡ε(\ displaystyle T_( x)=(\ frac(3)(2))(\ frac( Gm)( a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)))( C-A)\ sin\ epsilon\ cos\ epsilon) where

 a(\ displaystyle a)= semimajor axis of Earth's( Sun's) orbit or Moon's orbit e= eccentricity of Earth's( Sun's) orbit or Moon's orbit and1/2 accounts for the average of the sine squared waveform, a3(1− e2)3/2(\ displaystyle a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)) accounts for the average distance cubed of the Sun or Moon from Earth over the entire elliptical orbit, andε(\ displaystyle\ epsilon\,\!)( the angle between the equatorial plane and the ecliptic plane) is the maximum value ofδ for the Sun and the average maximum value for the Moon over an entire18.6 year cycle.

 Precession is:

 dψ d t= T x Cω sin⁡ε(\ displaystyle(\ frac( d\ psi)( dt))=(\ frac( T_( x))( C\ omega\ sin\ epsilon))) whereω is Earth's angular velocity and Cω is Earth's angular momentum. Thus the first order component of precession due to the Sun is:

 dψ S d t=32( G m a3(1− e2)3/2) S(( C− A) C cos⁡εω) E(\ displaystyle(\ frac( d\ psi_( S))( dt))=(\ frac(3)(2))\ left((\ frac( Gm)( a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)))\ right)_( S)\ left((\ frac(( C-A))( C))(\ frac(\ cos\ epsilon)(\ omega))\ right)_( E)) whereas that due to the Moon is:

 dψ L d t=32( G m(1−1.5 sin2⁡ i) a3(1− e2)3/2) L(( C− A) C cos⁡εω) E(\ displaystyle(\ frac( d\ psi_( L))( dt))=(\ frac(3)(2))\ left((\ frac( Gm(1-1.5\ sin^(2) i))( a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)))\ right)_( L)\ left((\ frac(( C-A))( C))(\ frac(\ cos\ epsilon)(\ omega))\ right)_( E)) where i is the angle between the plane of the Moon's orbit and the ecliptic plane. In these two equations, the Sun's parameters are within square brackets labeled S, the Moon's parameters are within square brackets labeled L, and the Earth's parameters are within square brackets labeled E. The term(1−1.5 sin2⁡ i)(\ displaystyle(1-1.5\ sin^(2) i)) accounts for the inclination of the Moon's orbit relative to the ecliptic. The term( C− A)/ C is Earth's dynamical ellipticity or flattening, which is adjusted to the observed precession because Earth's internal structure is not known with sufficient detail. If Earth were homogeneous the term would equal its third eccentricity squared,

The solar equation is a good representation of precession due the Sun because Earth's orbit is close to an ellipse, being only slightly perturbed by the other planets. The lunar equation is not as good a representation of precession due to the Moon because the Moon's orbit is greatly distorted by the Sun and neither the radius nor the eccentricity is constant over the year.

 Values( edit)

 Simon Newcomb's calculation at the end of the19th century for general precession( p) in longitude gave a value of5,025.64 arcseconds per tropical century, and was the generally accepted value until artificial satellites delivered more accurate observations and electronic computers allowed more elaborate models to be calculated. Lieske developed an updated theory in1976, where p equals5,029.0966 arcseconds per Julian century. Modern techniques such as VLBI and LLR allowed further refinements, and the International Astronomical Union adopted a new constant value in2000, and new computation methods and polynomial expressions in2003 and2006; the accumulated precession is:

 p=5,028.796195× T+1.1054348× T+ higher order terms, in arcseconds, with T, the time in Julian centuries( that is,36,525 days) since the epoch of2000.

 The rate of precession is the derivative of that:

 p=5,028.796195+2.2108696× T+ higher order terms. The constant term of this speed(5,028.796195 arcseconds per century in above equation) corresponds to one full precession circle in25,771.57534 years( one full circle of360 degrees divided with5,028.796195 arcseconds per century) although some other sources put the value at25771.4 years, leaving a small uncertainty.

 The precession rate is not a constant, but is( at the moment) slowly increasing over time, as indicated by the linear( and higher order) terms in T. In any case it must be stressed that this formula is only valid over a limited time period. It is a polynomial expression centred on the J2000 datum, empirically fitted to observational data, not on a deterministic model of the solar system. It is clear that if T gets large enough( far in the future or far in the past), the T2 term will dominate and p will go to very large values. In reality, more elaborate calculations on the numerical model of the Solar System show that the precessional constants have a period of about41,000 years, the same as the obliquity of the ecliptic. Note that the constants mentioned here are the linear and all higher terms of the formula above, not the precession itself. That is,

 p= A+ BT+ CT+... is an approximation of

 p= a+ b sin(2πT/ P), where P is the41,000 year period. Theoretical models may calculate the constants( coefficients) corresponding to the higher powers of T, but since it is impossible for a( finite) polynomial to match a periodic function over all numbers, the difference in all such approximations will grow without bound as T increases. However, greater accuracy can be obtained over a limited time span by fitting a high enough order polynomial to observation data, rather than a necessarily imperfect dynamic numerical model. So for present flight trajectory calculations of artificial satellites and spacecraft, the polynomial method gives better accuracy. In that respect, the International Astronomical Union chose the best- developed available theory. For up to a few centuries in the past and the future, all formulas do not diverge very much. For up to a few thousand years in the past and the future, most agree to some accuracy. For eras farther out, discrepancies become too large-- the exact rate and period of precession may not be computed using these polynomials even for a single whole precession period.

 The precession of Earth's axis is a very slow effect, but at the level of accuracy at which astronomers work, it does need to be taken into account on a daily basis. Note that although the precession and the tilt of Earth's axis( the obliquity of the ecliptic) are calculated from the same theory and thus, are related to each other, the two movements act independently of each other, moving in opposite directions.

 Precession exhibits a secular decrease due to tidal dissipation from59``/ a to45''/ a( a= annum= Julian year) during the500 million year period centered on the present. After short- term fluctuations( tens of thousands of years) are averaged out, the long- term trend can be approximated by the following polynomials for negative and positive time from the present in``/ a, where T is in billions of Julian years( Ga):

 p=50.475838−26.368583T+21.890862T p=50.475838−27.000654T+15.603265T Precession will be greater than p by the small amount of+0.135052``/ a between+30 Ma and+130 Ma. The jump to this excess over p will occur in only20 Ma beginning now because the secular decrease in precession is beginning to cross a resonance in Earth's orbit caused by the other planets.

 According to Ward, when, in about1,500 million years, the distance of the Moon, which is continuously increasing from tidal effects, has increased from the current60.3 to approximately66.5 Earth radii, resonances from planetary effects will push precession to49,000 years at first, and then, when the Moon reaches68 Earth radii in about2,000 million years, to69,000 years. This will be associated with wild swings in the obliquity of the ecliptic as well. Ward, however, used the abnormally large modern value for tidal dissipation. Using the620- million year average provided by tidal rhythmites of about half the modern value, these resonances will not be reached until about3,000 and4,000 million years, respectively. However, due to the gradually increasing luminosity of the Sun, unless the atmosphere is artificially shielded, the oceans of the Earth will have vaporized before that time( about2,100 million years from now).

 Jump to: navigation, search`` Obliquity'' redirects here. For the book, see Obliquity( book). In astronomy, axial tilt, also known as obliquity, is the angle between an object's rotational axis and its orbital axis, or, equivalently, the angle between its equatorial plane and orbital plane. It differs from orbital inclination.

 At an obliquity of zero, the two axes point in the same direction; i.e., the rotational axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane. Earth's obliquity oscillates between22.1 and24.5 degrees on a41,000- year cycle; the earth's mean obliquity is currently23°26′12.9''( or23.43693°) and decreasing.

 Over the course of an orbit, the obliquity usually does not change considerably, and the orientation of the axis remains the same relative to the background stars. This causes one pole to be directed more toward the Sun on one side of the orbit, and the other pole on the other side-- the cause of the seasons on the Earth.

 Standards( edit)

 The positive pole of a planet is defined by the right- hand rule: if the fingers of the right hand are curled in the direction of the rotation then the thumb points to the positive pole. The axial tilt is defined as the angle between the direction of the positive pole and the normal to the orbital plane. The angles for Earth, Uranus and Venus are approximately23°,97°, and177° respectively.

 There are two standard methods of specifying tilt. The International Astronomical Union( IAU) defines the north pole of a planet as that which lies on Earth's north side of the invariable plane of the Solar System; under this system, Venus is tilted3° and spins retrograde, opposite that of most of the other planets.

 The IAU also uses the right- hand rule to define a positive pole for the purpose of determining orientation. Using this convention, Venus is tilted177°(`` upside down'').

 Earth( edit)

 Earth's axial tilt( obliquity) is currently about23.4°. Earth's orbital plane is known as the ecliptic plane, and Earth's tilt is known to astronomers as the obliquity of the ecliptic, being the angle between the ecliptic and the celestial equator on the celestial sphere. It is denoted by the Greek letterε.

 Earth currently has an axial tilt of about23.4°. This value remains about the same relative to a stationary orbital plane throughout the cycles of axial precession. But the ecliptic( i.e., Earth's orbit) moves due to planetary perturbations, and the obliquity of the ecliptic is not a fixed quantity. At present, it is decreasing at a rate of about47'' per century( see details in Short term below).

 History( edit)

 Earth's obliquity may have been reasonably accurately measured as early as1100 BC in India and China. The ancient Greeks had good measurements of the obliquity since about350 BC, when Pytheas of Marseilles measured the shadow of a gnomon at the summer solstice. About830 AD, the Caliph Al- Mamun of Baghdad directed his astronomers to measure the obliquity, and the result was used in the Arab world for many years. In1437, Ulugh Beg determined the Earth's axial tilt as23°30′17''(23.5047°).

 It was widely believed, during the Middle Ages, that both precession and Earth's obliquity oscillated around a mean value, with a period of672 years, an idea known as trepidation of the equinoxes. Perhaps the first to realize this was incorrect( during historic time) was Ibn al- Shatir in the fourteenth century and the first to realize that the obliquity is decreasing at a relatively constant rate was Fracastoro in1538. The first accurate, modern, western observations of the obliquity were probably those of Tycho Brahe from Denmark, about1584, although observations by several others, including al- Ma'mun, al- Tusi, Purbach, Regiomontanus, and Walther, could have provided similar information.

 Seasons( edit)

 Main article: Season Earth's axis remains tilted in the same direction with reference to the background stars throughout a year( regardless of where it is in its orbit). This means that one pole( and the associated hemisphere of Earth) will be directed away from the Sun at one side of the orbit, and half an orbit later( half a year later) this pole will be directed towards the Sun. This is the cause of Earth's seasons. Summer occurs in the Northern hemisphere when the north pole is directed toward the Sun. Variations in Earth's axial tilt can influence the seasons and is likely a factor in long- term climate change( also see Milankovitch cycles).

 Relationship between Earth's axial tilt(ε) to the tropical and polar circles Oscillation( edit)

 Short term( edit) Obliquity of the ecliptic for20,000 years, from Laskar(1986). The red point represents the year2000. The exact angular value of the obliquity is found by observation of the motions of Earth and planets over many years. Astronomers produce new fundamental ephemerides as the accuracy of observation improves and as the understanding of the dynamics increases, and from these ephemerides various astronomical values, including the obliquity, are derived.

 Annual almanacs are published listing the derived values and methods of use. Until1983, the Astronomical Almanac's angular value of the mean obliquity for any date was calculated based on the work of Newcomb, who analyzed positions of the planets until about1895:

ε=23°27′8.26''−46.845'' T−0.0059'' T+6997181000000000000♠0.00181'' T whereε is the obliquity and T is tropical centuries from B1900.0 to the date in question.

 From1984, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's DE series of computer- generated ephemerides took over as the fundamental ephemeris of the Astronomical Almanac. Obliquity based on DE200, which analyzed observations from1911 to1979, was calculated:

ε=23°26′21.45''−46.815'' T−0.0006'' T+6997181000000000000♠0.00181'' T where hereafter T is Julian centuries from J2000.0.

 JPL's fundamental ephemerides have been continually updated. For instance, the Astronomical Almanac for2010 specifies:

ε=23°26′21.406''−7001468367689999999♠46.836769'' T−6996183100000000000♠0.0001831'' T+6997200339999999999♠0.00200340'' T−5.76''×10 T−4.34''×10 T These expressions for the obliquity are intended for high precision over a relatively short time span, perhaps± several centuries. J. Laskar computed an expression to order T good to0.02'' over1000 years and several arcseconds over10,000 years.

ε=23°26′21.448''−4680.93'' t−1.55'' t+1999.25'' t−51.38'' t−249.67'' t−39.05'' t+7.12'' t+27.87'' t+5.79'' t+2.45'' t where here t is multiples of10,000 Julian years from J2000.0.

 These expressions are for the so- called mean obliquity, that is, the obliquity free from short- term variations. Periodic motions of the Moon and of Earth in its orbit cause much smaller(9.2 arcseconds) short- period( about18.6 years) oscillations of the rotation axis of Earth, known as nutation, which add a periodic component to Earth's obliquity. The true or instantaneous obliquity includes this nutation.

 Long term( edit) Main article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System Using numerical methods to simulate Solar System behavior, long- term changes in Earth's orbit, and hence its obliquity, have been investigated over a period of several million years. For the past5 million years, Earth's obliquity has varied between22°2′33'' and24°30′16'', with a mean period of41,040 years. This cycle is a combination of precession and the largest term in the motion of the ecliptic. For the next1 million years, the cycle will carry the obliquity between22°13′44'' and24°20′50''.

 The Moon has a stabilizing effect on Earth's obliquity. Frequency map analysis conducted in1993 suggested that, in the absence of the Moon, the obliquity can change rapidly due to orbital resonances and chaotic behavior of the Solar System, reaching as high as90° in as little as a few million years( also see Orbit of the Moon). However, more recent numerical simulations made in2011 indicated that even in the absence of the Moon, Earth's obliquity might not be quite so unstable; varying only by about20--25°. To resolve this contradiction, diffusion rate of obliquity has been calculated, and it was found that it takes more than billions of years for Earth's obliquity to reach near90°. The Moon's stabilizing effect will continue for less than2 billion years. As the Moon continues to recede from Earth due to tidal acceleration, resonances may occur which will cause large oscillations of the obliquity.

 Long- term obliquity of the ecliptic. Left: for the past5 million years; note that the obliquity varies only from about22.0° to24.5°. Right: for the next1 million years; note the approx.41,000- year period of variation. In both graphs, the red point represents the year1850.( Source: Berger,1976). Solar System bodies( edit)

 All four of the innermost, rocky planets of the Solar System may have had large variations of their obliquity in the past. Since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane, it changes as the orbital plane changes due to the influence of other planets. But the axis of rotation can also move( axial precession), due to torque exerted by the sun on a planet's equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession. If the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes. The rate varies due to tidal dissipation and core- mantle interaction, among other things. When a planet's precession rate approaches certain values, orbital resonances may cause large changes in obliquity. The amplitude of the contribution having one of the resonant rates is divided by the difference between the resonant rate and the precession rate, so it becomes large when the two are similar. Mercury and Venus have most likely been stabilized by the tidal dissipation of the Sun. Earth was stabilized by the Moon, as mentioned above, but before its capture, Earth, too, could have passed through times of instability. Mars's obliquity is quite variable over millions of years and may be in a chaotic state; it varies as much as0° to60° over some millions of years, depending on perturbations of the planets. Some authors dispute that Mars's obliquity is chaotic, and show that tidal dissipation and viscous core- mantle coupling are adequate for it to have reached a fully damped state, similar to Mercury and Venus. The occasional shifts in the axial tilt of Mars have been suggested as an explanation for the appearance and disappearance of rivers and lakes over the course of the existence of Mars. A shift could cause a burst of methane into the atmosphere, causing warming, but then the methane would be destroyed and the climate would become arid again.

 The obliquities of the outer planets are considered relatively stable.

Extrasolar planets( edit)

 Further information: Exoplanet§ Rotation and axial tilt The stellar obliquityψ, i.e. the axial tilt of a star with respect to the orbital plane of one of its planets, has been determined for only a few systems. But for49 stars as of today, the sky- projected spin- orbit misalignmentλ has been observed, which serves as a lower limit toψ. Most of these measurements rely on the Rossiter-- McLaughlin effect. So far, it has not been possible to constrain the obliquity of an extrasolar planet. But the rotational flattening of the planet and the entourage of moons and/ or rings, which are traceable with high- precision photometry, e.g. by the space- based Kepler spacecraft, could provide access toψ in the near future.

 Astrophysicists have applied tidal theories to predict the obliquity of extrasolar planets. It has been shown that the obliquities of exoplanets in the habitable zone around low- mass stars tend to be eroded in less than10 years, which means that they would not have seasons as Earth has.

 Jump to: navigation, search For the thermonuclear reaction involving carbon that powers some stars, see CNO cycle. For organic chemical ring- shaped structures, see Cyclic compounds. Movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and ocean in billions of tons per year. Yellow numbers are natural fluxes, red are human contributions, white are stored carbon. The effects of volcanic and tectonic activity are not included. The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth. Carbon is the main component of biological compounds as well as a major component of many minerals such as limestone. Along with the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle, the carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to make Earth capable of sustaining life. It describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere, as well as long- term processes of carbon sequestration to and release from carbon sinks.

 The carbon cycle was initially discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, and popularized by Humphry Davy.

 The atmosphere The terrestrial biosphere The ocean, including dissolved inorganic carbon and living and non-living marine biota The sediments, including fossil fuels, fresh water systems and non-living organic material. The Earth's interior( mantle and crust. These carbon stores interact with the other components through geological processes. The carbon exchanges between reservoirs occur as the result of various chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes. The ocean contains the largest active pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth. The natural flows of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial ecosystems, and sediments is fairly balanced, so that carbon levels would be roughly stable without human influence.

 Atmosphere( edit)

 Main article: Atmospheric carbon cycle Epiphytes on electric wires. This kind of plant takes both CO and water from the atmosphere for living and growing. Carbon in the Earth's atmosphere exists in two main forms: carbon dioxide and methane. Both of these gases absorb and retain heat in the atmosphere and are partially responsible for the greenhouse effect. Methane produces a larger greenhouse effect per volume as compared to carbon dioxide, but it exists in much lower concentrations and is more short- lived than carbon dioxide, making carbon dioxide the more important greenhouse gas of the two.

 Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere primarily through photosynthesis and enters the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres. Carbon dioxide also dissolves directly from the atmosphere into bodies of water( ocean, lakes, etc.), as well as dissolving in precipitation as raindrops fall through the atmosphere. When dissolved in water, carbon dioxide reacts with water molecules and forms carbonic acid, which contributes to ocean acidity. It can then be absorbed by rocks through weathering. It also can acidify other surfaces it touches or be washed into the ocean.

 Human activities over the past two centuries have significantly increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, mainly in the form of carbon dioxide, both by modifying ecosystems' ability to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and by emitting it directly, e.g., by burning fossil fuels and manufacturing concrete.

 Terrestrial biosphere( edit)

 Main article: Terrestrial biological carbon cycle A portable soil respiration system measuring soil CO flux The terrestrial biosphere includes the organic carbon in all land- living organisms, both alive and dead, as well as carbon stored in soils. About500 gigatons of carbon are stored above ground in plants and other living organisms, while soil holds approximately1,500 gigatons of carbon. Most carbon in the terrestrial biosphere is organic carbon, while about a third of soil carbon is stored in inorganic forms, such as calcium carbonate. Organic carbon is a major component of all organisms living on earth. Autotrophs extract it from the air in the form of carbon dioxide, converting it into organic carbon, while heterotrophs receive carbon by consuming other organisms.

 Because carbon uptake in the terrestrial biosphere is dependent on biotic factors, it follows a diurnal and seasonal cycle. In CO measurements, this feature is apparent in the Keeling curve. It is strongest in the northern hemisphere, because this hemisphere has more land mass than the southern hemisphere and thus more room for ecosystems to absorb and emit carbon.

 Carbon leaves the terrestrial biosphere in several ways and on different time scales. The combustion or respiration of organic carbon releases it rapidly into the atmosphere. It can also be exported into the ocean through rivers or remain sequestered in soils in the form of inert carbon. Carbon stored in soil can remain there for up to thousands of years before being washed into rivers by erosion or released into the atmosphere through soil respiration. Between1989 and2008 soil respiration increased by about0.1% per year. In2008, the global total of CO released from the soil reached roughly98 billion tonnes, about10 times more carbon than humans are now putting into the atmosphere each year by burning fossil fuel. There are a few plausible explanations for this trend, but the most likely explanation is that increasing temperatures have increased rates of decomposition of soil organic matter, which has increased the flow of CO. The length of carbon sequestering in soil is dependent on local climatic conditions and thus changes in the course of climate change. From pre-industrial era to2010, the terrestrial biosphere represented a net source of atmospheric CO prior to1940, switching subsequently to a net sink.

 Ocean( edit)

 Main article: Oceanic carbon cycle The ocean contains the greatest quantity of actively cycled carbon in this world and are second only to the lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store. Its surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved inorganic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon( DIC) is about15% higher than that of the surface layer. DIC is stored in the deep layer for much longer periods of time. Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.

 Carbon enters the ocean mainly through the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is converted into carbonate. It can also enter the ocean through rivers as dissolved organic carbon. It is converted by organisms into organic carbon through photosynthesis and can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the ocean's deeper, more carbon rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells as calcium carbonate. It circulates in this layer for long periods of time before either being deposited as sediment or, eventually, returned to the surface waters through thermohaline circulation.

 Oceanic absorption of CO is one of the most important forms of carbon sequestering limiting the human- caused rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, this process is limited by a number of factors. Because the rate of CO dissolution in the ocean is dependent on the weathering of rocks and this process takes place slower than current rates of human greenhouse gas emissions, ocean CO uptake will decrease in the future. CO absorption also makes water more acidic, which affects ocean biosystems. The projected rate of increasing oceanic acidity could slow the biological precipitation of calcium carbonates, thus decreasing the ocean's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide.

 Earth's interior( edit)

 The geologic component of the carbon cycle operates slowly in comparison to the other parts of the global carbon cycle. It is one of the most important determinants of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus of global temperatures.

 Most of the earth's carbon is stored inertly in the earth's lithosphere. Much of the carbon stored in the earth's mantle was stored there when the earth formed. Some of it was deposited in the form of organic carbon from the biosphere. Of the carbon stored in the geosphere, about80% is limestone and its derivatives, which form from the sedimentation of calcium carbonate stored in the shells of marine organisms. The remaining20% is stored as kerogens formed through the sedimentation and burial of terrestrial organisms under high heat and pressure. Organic carbon stored in the geosphere can remain there for millions of years.

 Carbon can leave the geosphere in several ways. Carbon dioxide is released during the metamorphosis of carbonate rocks when they are subducted into the earth's mantle. This carbon dioxide can be released into the atmosphere and ocean through volcanoes and hotspots. It can also be removed by humans through the direct extraction of kerogens in the form of fossil fuels. After extraction, fossil fuels are burned to release energy, thus emitting the carbon they store into the atmosphere.

 Human influence( edit)

 Main article: Global warming Human activity since the industrial era has changed the balance in the natural carbon cycle. Units are in gigatons. CO in Earth's atmosphere if half of global- warming emissions are not absorbed.( NASA computer simulation). Since the industrial revolution, human activity has modified the carbon cycle by changing its components' functions and directly adding carbon to the atmosphere.

 The largest human impact on the carbon cycle is through direct emissions from burning fossil fuels, which transfers carbon from the geosphere into the atmosphere. The rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land- use, particularly deforestation.

 Another direct human impact on the carbon cycle is the chemical process of calcination of limestone for clinker production, which releases CO. Clinker is an industrial precursor of cement.

 Humans also influence the carbon cycle indirectly by changing the terrestrial and oceanic biosphere. Over the past several centuries, direct and indirect human- caused land use and land cover change( LUCC) has led to the loss of biodiversity, which lowers ecosystems' resilience to environmental stresses and decreases their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. More directly, it often leads to the release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere. Deforestation for agricultural purposes removes forests, which hold large amounts of carbon, and replaces them, generally with agricultural or urban areas. Both of these replacement land cover types store comparatively small amounts of carbon, so that the net product of the process is that more carbon stays in the atmosphere.

 Other human- caused changes to the environment change ecosystems' productivity and their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Air pollution, for example, damages plants and soils, while many agricultural and land use practices lead to higher erosion rates, washing carbon out of soils and decreasing plant productivity.

 Humans also affect the oceanic carbon cycle. Current trends in climate change lead to higher ocean temperatures, thus modifying ecosystems. Also, acid rain and polluted runoff from agriculture and industry change the ocean's chemical composition. Such changes can have dramatic effects on highly sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs, thus limiting the ocean's ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere on a regional scale and reducing oceanic biodiversity globally.

 Arctic methane emissions indirectly caused by anthropogenic global warming also affect the carbon cycle, and contribute to further warming in what is known as climate change feedback.

 On12 November2015, NASA scientists reported that human- made carbon dioxide( CO) continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years: currently, about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels remains in the atmosphere and is not absorbed by vegetation and the ocean.

 Jump to: navigation, search Carbon dioxide in Earth's troposphere2011 carbon dioxide mole fraction in the troposphere Play media This visualization shows global carbon dioxide concentrations( colored squares) in parts per million by volume( ppmv). Play media A model of the behavior of carbon in the atmosphere from September1,2014 to August31,2015. The height of Earth's atmosphere and topography have been vertically exaggerated and appear approximately40 times higher than normal to show the complexity of the atmospheric flow. Carbon dioxide( CO) is an important trace gas in Earth's atmosphere. CO is a major greenhouse gas and plays a vital role in regulating Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide is an integral part of the carbon cycle, a biogeochemical cycle in which carbon is exchanged between the Earth's oceans, soil, rocks and the biosphere. Plants and other photoautotrophs use solar energy to produce carbohydrate from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water by photosynthesis. Almost all other organisms depend on carbohydrate derived from photosynthesis as their primary source of energy and carbon compounds.

 Reconstructions show that concentrations of CO in the atmosphere have varied from as high as7,000 parts per million( ppm) during the Cambrian period about500 million years ago to as low as180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years. Global annual mean CO concentration has increased by more than45% since the start of the Industrial Revolution. The concentration was280 ppm during the10,000 years up to the mid-18th century, increasing to407 ppm as of mid-2017. The present concentration is the highest in at least the past800,000 years and likely the highest in the past20 million years. The increase has been caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. This increase of CO and other greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere has produced the current episode of global warming. About30--40% of the CO released by humans into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans, rivers and lakes, which has produced ocean acidification.

 Current concentration( edit)

 See also: Global warming, Climate change, Atmospheric methane, Holocene climate, and Quaternary climate CO concentrations over the last400,000 years Over the past400,000 years, CO concentrations have shown several cycles of variation from about180 parts per million during the deep glaciations of the Holocene and Pleistocene to280 parts per million during the interglacial periods. Each part per million by volume of CO in the atmosphere contains approximately2.13 gigatonnes of carbon. Currently CO constitutes about0.041%( equal to410 ppm) by volume of the atmosphere, which corresponds to approximately3200 gigatons of CO, which includes approximately870 gigatons of carbon. The global mean CO concentration is currently rising at a rate of approximately2 ppm/ year and accelerating.

 Following the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO concentration has increased to over400 parts per million and continues to increase. The daily average concentration of atmospheric CO at Mauna Loa Observatory first exceeded400 ppm on10 May2013. This has caused the phenomenon of global warming. The global average concentration of CO in Earth's atmosphere is currently about0.04%, or400 parts per million by volume( ppm). There is an annual fluctuation of about3--9 ppm which is negatively correlated with the Northern Hemisphere's growing season. The Northern Hemisphere dominates the annual cycle of CO concentration because it has much greater land area and plant biomass than the Southern Hemisphere. Concentrations reach a peak in May as the Northern Hemisphere spring greenup begins, and decline to a minimum in October, near the end of the growing season.

 Since global warming is attributed to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO, scientists closely monitor atmospheric CO concentrations and their impact on the present- day biosphere. At the scientific recording station in Mauna Loa, the concentration reached400 ppm for the first time in May2013, although this concentration had already been reached in the Arctic in June2012. The National Geographic wrote that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is this high`` for the first time in55 years of measurement-- and probably more than3 million years of Earth history.'' The current concentration may be the highest in the last20 million years.

 Past concentration( edit)

 See also: Paleoclimatology and Great Oxygenation Event Changes in carbon dioxide during the Phanerozoic( the last542 million years). The recent period is located on the left side of the plot. This figure illustrates a range of events over the last550 million years during which CO played a role in global climate. The graph begins( on the right) with an era predating terrestrial plant life, during which solar output was more than4% lower than today. Land plants only became widespread after400Ma, during the Devonian( D) period, and their diversification( along with the evolution of leaves) may have been partially driven by a decrease in CO concentration. Toward the left side of the graph the sun gradually approaches modern levels of solar output, while vegetation spreads, removing large amounts of CO from the atmosphere. The last200 million years includes periods of extreme warmth, and sea levels so high that200 metre- deep shallow seas formed on continental land masses( for example, at100Ma during the Cretaceous( K) Greenhouse). At the far left of the graph, we see modern CO levels and the appearance of the climate under which human species and human civilization developed.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.( July2016)( Learn how and when to remove this template message) Carbon dioxide concentrations have varied widely over the Earth's4.54 billion year history. Carbon dioxide is believed to have been present in Earth's first atmosphere, shortly after Earth's formation. Earth's second atmosphere emerged after the lighter gases, hydrogen and helium, escaped to space or like oxygen were bound up in molecules and is thought to have consisted largely of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and inert gases produced by outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by asteroids. The production of free oxygen by cyanobacterial photosynthesis eventually led to the oxygen catastrophe that ended Earth's second atmosphere and brought about the Earth's third atmosphere( the modern atmosphere)2.4 billion years before the present. Carbon dioxide concentrations dropped from7,000 parts per million during the Cambrian period about500 million years ago to as low as180 parts per million during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.

 Drivers of ancient- Earth carbon dioxide concentration( edit)

 On long timescales, atmospheric CO concentration is determined by the balance among geochemical processes including organic carbon burial in sediments, silicate rock weathering, and volcanism. The net effect of slight imbalances in the carbon cycle over tens to hundreds of millions of years has been to reduce atmospheric CO. On a timescale of billions of years, such downward trend appears bound to continue indefinitely as occasional massive historical releases of buried carbon due to volcanism will become less frequent( as earth mantle cooling and progressive exhaustion of internal radioactive heat proceeds further). The rates of these processes are extremely slow; hence they are of no relevance to the atmospheric CO concentration over the next hundreds or thousands of years.

 In billion- year timescales, it is predicted that plant, and therefore animal, life on land will die off altogether, since by that time most of the remaining carbon in the atmosphere will be sequestered underground, and natural releases of CO by radioactivity- driven tectonic activity will have continued to slow down. The loss of plant life would also result in the eventual loss of oxygen. Some microbes are capable of photosynthesis at concentrations of CO of a few parts per million and so the last life forms would probably disappear finally due to the rising temperatures and loss of the atmosphere when the sun becomes a red giant some four billion years from now.

 Measuring ancient- Earth carbon dioxide concentration( edit)

 See also: climate reconstruction proxies Graph of CO( green), reconstructed temperature( blue) and dust( red) from the Vostok ice core for the past420,000 years The most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations for periods before instrumental sampling is to measure bubbles of air( fluid or gas inclusions) trapped in the Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets. The most widely accepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate that atmospheric CO concentrations were about260--280 ppmv immediately before industrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the preceding10,000 years. The longest ice core record comes from East Antarctica, where ice has been sampled to an age of800,000 years. During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has varied between180--210 ppm during ice ages, increasing to280--300 ppm during warmer interglacials. The beginning of human agriculture during the current Holocene epoch may have been strongly connected to the atmospheric CO increase after the last ice age ended, a fertilization effect raising plant biomass growth and reducing stomatal conductance requirements for CO intake, consequently reducing transpiration water losses and increasing water usage efficiency.

 Various proxy measurements have been used to attempt to determine atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations millions of years in the past. These include boron and carbon isotope ratios in certain types of marine sediments, and the number of stomata observed on fossil plant leaves. While these measurements give much less precise estimates of carbon dioxide concentration than ice cores, there is evidence for very high CO volume concentrations between200 and150 million years ago of over3,000 ppm, and between600 and400 million years ago of over6,000 ppm. In more recent times, atmospheric CO concentration continued to fall after about60 million years ago. About34 million years ago, the time of the Eocene-- Oligocene extinction event and when the Antarctic ice sheet started to take its current form, CO is found to have been about760 ppm, and there is geochemical evidence that concentrations were less than300 ppm by about20 million years ago. Carbon dioxide decrease, with a tipping point of600 ppm, was the primary agent forcing Antarctic glaciation. Low CO concentrations may have been the stimulus that favored the evolution of C4 plants, which increased greatly in abundance between7 and5 million years ago.

 Ancient- Earth climate reconstruction is a vibrant field with numerous studies and reconstructions that sometimes reinforce one another and sometimes disagree with each other. Academically, one study disputed the claim of stable CO concentrations during the present interglacial of the last10,000 years. Based on an analysis of fossil leaves, Wagner et al. argued that CO levels during the last7,000--10,000 year period were significantly higher(~300 ppm) and contained substantial variations that may be correlated to climate variations. Others have disputed such claims, suggesting they are more likely to reflect calibration problems than actual changes in CO. Relevant to this dispute is the observation that Greenland ice cores often report higher and more variable CO values than similar measurements in Antarctica. However, the groups responsible for such measurements( e.g. H. J Smith et al.) believe the variations in Greenland cores result from in situ decomposition of calcium carbonate dust found in the ice. When dust concentrations in Greenland cores are low, as they nearly always are in Antarctic cores, the researchers report good agreement between measurements of Antarctic and Greenland CO concentrations.

 Atmospheric carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect( edit)

 Main articles: greenhouse effect and radiative forcing See also: Faint young Sun paradox and global warming A pictogram of the greenhouse effect Earth's natural greenhouse effect makes life as we know it possible and carbon dioxide plays a significant role in providing for the relatively warm temperature that the planet enjoys. The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's temperature would be about−18° C(-0.4° F) compared to Earth's actual surface temperature of approximately14° C(57.2° F).

 Carbon dioxide is believed to have played an important effect in regulating Earth's temperature throughout its4.7 billion year history. Early in the Earth's life, scientists have found evidence of liquid water indicating a warm world even though the Sun's output is believed to have only been70% of what it is today. It has been suggested by scientists that higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Earth atmosphere might help explain this faint young sun paradox. When Earth first formed, Earth's atmosphere may have contained more greenhouse gases and CO concentrations may have been higher, with estimated partial pressure as large as1,000 kPa(10 bar), because there was no bacterial photosynthesis to reduce the gas to carbon compounds and oxygen. Methane, a very active greenhouse gas which reacts with oxygen to produce CO and water vapor, may have been more prevalent as well, with a mixing ratio of10(100 parts per million by volume).

 Contribution of natural factors and human activities to radiative forcing( RF) of climate change. RF values are for year2005, relative to pre-industrial(1750). The contribution of solar irradiance to RF is5% the value of the combined RF due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Though water is responsible for most( about36-70%) of the total greenhouse effect, the role of water vapor as a greenhouse gas depends on temperature. On earth, carbon dioxide is the most relevant direct anthropologically influenced greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is often mentioned in the context of its increased influence as a greenhouse gas since the pre-industrial(1750) era. In the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report the increase in CO was estimated to be responsible for1.82 W m of the2.63 W m change in radiative forcing on earth( about70%).

 The concept of atmospheric CO increasing ground temperature was first published by Svante Arrhenius in1896. The increased radiative forcing due to increased CO in the earth's atmosphere is based on the physical properties of CO and the non-saturated absorption windows where CO absorbs outgoing long- wave energy.

 Atmospheric carbon dioxide and the carbon cycle( edit)

 Main articles: Carbon cycle and Atmospheric carbon cycle This diagram of the fast carbon cycle shows the movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and oceans in billions of tons of carbon per year. Yellow numbers are natural fluxes, red are human contributions in billions of tons of carbon per year. White numbers indicate stored carbon. Atmospheric carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the Earth's carbon cycle whereby carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by some natural processes such as photosynthesis and deposition of carbonates, to form limestones for example, and added back to the atmosphere by other natural processes such as respiration and the acid dissolution of carbonate deposits. There are two broad carbon cycles on earth: the fast carbon cycle and the slow carbon cycle. The fast carbon cycle refers to movements of carbon between the environment and living things in the biosphere whereas the slow carbon cycle involves the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, soil, rocks and volcanism. Both carbon cycles are intrinsically interconnected and atmospheric gaseous carbon dioxide facilitates the carbon cycle.

 Natural sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide include volcanic outgassing, the combustion of organic matter, wildfires and the respiration processes of living aerobic organisms. Man- made sources of carbon dioxide include the burning of fossil fuels for heating, power generation and transport, as well as some industrial processes such as cement making. It is also produced by various microorganisms from fermentation and cellular respiration. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria convert carbon dioxide to carbohydrates by a process called photosynthesis. They gain the energy needed for this reaction from absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll and other pigments. Oxygen, produced as a by- product of photosynthesis, is released into the atmosphere and subsequently used for respiration by heterotrophic organisms and other plants, forming a cycle.

 Most sources of CO emissions are natural, and are balanced to various degrees by natural CO sinks. For example, the natural decay of organic material in forests and grasslands and the action of forest fires results in the release of about439 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide every year, while new growth entirely counteracts this effect, absorbing450 gigatonnes per year. Although the initial carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the young Earth was produced by volcanic activity, modern volcanic activity releases only130 to230 megatonnes of carbon dioxide each year. These natural sources are nearly balanced by natural sinks, physical and biological processes which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. For example, some is directly removed from the atmosphere by land plants for photosynthesis and it is soluble in water forming carbonic acid. There is a large natural flux of CO into and out of the biosphere and oceans. In the pre-industrial era these fluxes were largely in balance. Currently about57% of human- emitted CO is removed by the biosphere and oceans. From pre-industrial era to2010, the terrestrial biosphere represented a net source of atmospheric CO prior to1940, switching subsequently to a net sink. The ratio of the increase in atmospheric CO to emitted CO is known as the airborne fraction( Keeling et al.,1995); this varies for short- term averages and is typically about45% over longer(5 year) periods. Estimated carbon in global terrestrial vegetation increased from approximately740 billion tons in1910 to780 billion tons in1990.

Orange labels: known ice ages. Also see: Human timeline and Nature timeline Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is essential to life and to the present planetary biosphere. Over the course of Earth's geologic history CO concentrations have played a role in biological evolution. The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide as sources of electrons, rather than water. Cyanobacteria appeared later, and the excess oxygen they produced contributed to the oxygen catastrophe, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. In recent geologic times, low CO concentrations below600 parts per million might have been the stimulus that favored the evolution of C4 plants which increased greatly in abundance between7 and5 million years ago over plants that use the less efficient C3 metabolic pathway. At current atmospheric pressures photosynthesis shuts down when atmospheric CO concentrations fall below150 ppm and200 ppm although some microbes can extract carbon from the air at much lower concentrations. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately130 terawatts, which is about six times larger than the current power consumption of human civilization. Photosynthetic organisms also convert around100--115 thousand million metric tonnes of carbon into biomass per year.

 Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O, and fixes CO into sugar. Photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from CO and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms that use light as a source of energy carry out photosynthesis, since photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than CO, as a source of carbon. In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This is called oxygenic photosynthesis. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. However, there are some types of bacteria that carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis, which consumes CO but does not release oxygen.

 Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction, so photosynthesis needs to supply both a source of energy to drive this process, and the electrons needed to convert CO into a carbohydrate. This addition of the electrons is a reduction reaction. In general outline and in effect, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration, in which glucose and other compounds are oxidized to produce CO and water, and to release exothermic chemical energy to drive the organism's metabolism. However, the two processes take place through a different sequence of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments.

 Most organisms that utilize photosynthesis to produce oxygen use visible light to do so, although at least three use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, far- red radiation.

 Impact on plant growth( edit)

 A1993 review of scientific greenhouse studies found that a doubling of CO concentration would stimulate the growth of156 different plant species by an average of37%. The amount of gain varied significantly by species, with some showing much greater gains, and a small number showing a loss. For example, a1979 greenhouse study compared the dry weights of cotton and maize plants grown in different greenhouses, one with double the CO concentration of the other. In the enriched CO air, the dry weight of40- day- old cotton plants doubled, but the dry weight of30- day- old maize plants increased by only20%.

 Because of concerns that greenhouse experiments might not adequately simulate the actual environment( such as competing plants), scientists developed Free- air carbon dioxide enrichment( FACE) experiments. In this procedure, plants are grown outdoors, and the CO concentration of the surrounding air is artificially elevated. FACE experiments, using generally lower CO levels than the greenhouse studies, showed lower gains in growth than greenhouse studies, with the gains depending heavily on the species under study. A2005 review of12 experiments at475-600 ppm showed an average gain of17% in crop yield, with legumes typically showing a greater response than other species, and C4 plants generally showing less. The review also stated that the reviewed experiments have their own limitations. The studied CO levels were lower, and most of the experiments were carried out in temperate regions.

 Atmospheric carbon dioxide and the Oceanic carbon cycle( edit)

 Main article: Oceanic carbon cycle See also: Solubility pump and Ocean acidification Air- sea exchange of CO The Earth's oceans contain a large amount of CO in the form of bicarbonate and carbonate ions-- much more than the amount in the atmosphere. The bicarbonate is produced in reactions between rock, water, and carbon dioxide. One example is the dissolution of calcium carbonate:

 CaCO3+ CO+ H2O⇌ Ca2++2 HCO− Reactions like this tend to buffer changes in atmospheric CO. Since the right side of the reaction produces an acidic compound, adding CO on the left side decreases the pH of sea water, a process which has been termed ocean acidification( pH of the ocean becomes more acidic although the pH value remains in the alkaline range). Reactions between CO and non-carbonate rocks also add bicarbonate to the seas. This can later undergo the reverse of the above reaction to form carbonate rocks, releasing half of the bicarbonate as CO. Over hundreds of millions of years, this has produced huge quantities of carbonate rocks.

 Ultimately, most of the CO emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean; however, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain. Even if equilibrium is reached, including dissolution of carbonate minerals, the increased concentration of bicarbonate and decreased or unchanged concentration of carbonate ion will give rise to a higher concentration of un-ionized carbonic acid and dissolved CO. This, along with higher temperatures, would mean a higher equilibrium concentration of CO in the air.

 Anthropogenic CO emissions( edit)

 See also: radiative forcing, List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions, and Global warming While CO absorption and release is always happening as a result of natural processes, the recent rise in CO levels in the atmosphere is known to be mainly due to human( anthropogenic) activity. There are4 ways human activity, especially fossil fuel burning, is known to have caused the rapid increase in atmospheric CO over the last few centuries.1) Various national statistics accounting for fossil fuel consumption, combined with knowledge of how much atmospheric CO is produced per unit of fossil fuel( e.g. liter of gasoline).2) By examining the ratio of various carbon isotopes in the atmosphere. The burning of long- buried fossil fuels releases CO containing carbon of different isotopic ratios to those of living plants, enabling distinction between natural and human- caused contributions to CO concentration.3) Higher atmospheric CO concentrations in the northern hemisphere, where most of the world's population lives( and emissions originate from), compared to the southern hemisphere. This difference has increased as anthropogenic emissions have increased.4) Atmospheric O levels are decreasing in earth's atmosphere as it reacts with the carbon in fossil fuels to form CO.

 Burning fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas is the leading cause of increased anthropogenic CO; deforestation is the second major cause. In2010,9.14 gigatonnes of carbon( GtC, equivalent to33.5 gigatonnes of CO or about4.3 ppm in earth's atmosphere) were released from fossil fuels and cement production worldwide, compared to6.15 GtC in1990. In addition, land use change contributed0.87 GtC in2010, compared to1.45 GtC in1990. In1997, human- caused Indonesian peat fires were estimated to have released between13% and40% of the average carbon emissions caused by the burning of fossil fuels around the world in a single year. In the period1751 to1900, about12 GtC were released as CO to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels, whereas from1901 to2013 the figure was about380 GtC.

 CO in Earth's atmosphere if half of anthropogenic CO emissions are not absorbed.( NASA computer simulation). Anthropogenic carbon emissions exceed the amount that can be taken up or balanced out by natural sinks. As a result, carbon dioxide has gradually accumulated in the atmosphere, and as of2013, its concentration is almost43% above pre-industrial levels. Various techniques have been proposed for removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in carbon dioxide sinks. Currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the atmosphere.

 Excess CO emitted since the pre-industrial era is projected to remain in the atmosphere for centuries to millennia, even after emissions stop. Even if human carbon dioxide emissions were to completely cease, atmospheric temperatures are not expected to decrease significantly for thousands of years.

 Ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO( edit)

 See also: TCCON and Space- based measurements of carbon dioxide Carbon Dioxide observations from2005 to2014 showing the seasonal variations and the difference between northern and southern hemispheres The first reproducibly accurate measurements of atmospheric CO were from flask sample measurements made by Dave Keeling at Caltech in the1950s. A few years later in March1958 the first ongoing measurements were started by Keeling at Mauna Loa. Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since then. Now measurements are made at many sites globally. Additional measurement techniques are also used as well. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks. Global network data are often made publicly available on the conditions of proper acknowledgement according to the respective data user policies.

 There are several surface measurement( including flasks and continuous in situ) networks including NOAA/ ERSL, WDCGG, and RAMCES. The NOAA/ ESRL Baseline Observatory Network, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Network data are hosted at the CDIAC at ORNL. The World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases( WDCGG), part of GAW, data are hosted by the JMA. The Reseau Atmospherique de Mesure des Composes an Effet de Serre database( RAMCES) is part of IPSL.

 From these measurements, further products are made which integrate data from the various sources. These products also address issues such as data discontinuity and sparseness. GLOBALVIEW- CO2 is one of these products.

 Ongoing ground- based total column measurements began more recently. Column measurements typically refer to an averaged column amount denoted X, rather than a surface only measurement. These measurements are made by the TCCON. These data are also hosted on the CDIAC, and made publicly available according to the data use policy.

 Satellite measurements are also a recent addition to atmospheric X measurements. SCIAMACHY aboard ESA's ENVISAT made global column X measurements from2002-2012. AIRS aboard NASA's Aqua satellite makes global X measurements and was launched shortly after ENVISAT in2012. More recent satellites have significantly improved the data density and precision of global measurements. Newer missions have higher spectral and spatial resolutions. JAXA's GOSAT was the first dedicated GHG monitoring satellite to successfully achieve orbit in2009. NASA's OCO-2 launched in2014 was the second. Various other satellites missions to measure atmospheric X are planned.

 Jump to: navigation, search For other uses, see Continent( disambiguation). Animated, colour- coded map showing the various continents and regions. Depending on the convention and model, some continents may be consolidated or subdivided: for example, Eurasia is most often subdivided into Asia and Europe( red shades), while North and South America are sometimes recognised as one American continent( green shades). A continent is one of several very large landmasses of the world. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.

 Geologically the continents largely correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental plates. However, some areas of continental crust are regions covered with water not usually included in the list of continents. The area referred to as Zealandia is one such area( see submerged continents below).

 Islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into geopolitical regions. Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a geopolitical region called Oceania.

 Definitions and application

 A Dymaxion map shows land masses with minimal shape distortion. By convention,`` continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water.'' Several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water. The criterion`` large'' leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a surface area of2,166,086 square kilometres(836,330 sq mi) is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at7,617,930 square kilometres(2,941,300 sq mi) is deemed the smallest continent.

 Earth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which is divided into a number of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.

 Extent

 The most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe( sometimes referred to in Britain as`` the Continent'') is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands such as Great Britain, Ireland, Malta and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the mainland of Australia, excluding Tasmania and New Guinea. Similarly, the continental United States refers to the48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in central North America and may include Alaska in the northwest of the continent( the two being separated by Canada), while excluding Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam in the oceans.

 From the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area( the continental shelf) and the islands on the shelf( continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.

 From this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level. In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.

 Map of island countries: these states are often grouped geographically with a neighboring continental landmass. As a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and Madagascar part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the Australian continental plate with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called Oceania. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.

 Separation

 Main article: Boundaries between the continents of Earth See also: List of transcontinental countries The ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as`` more or less discrete masses of land''. Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water( disregarding the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk of the landmasses they unite.

 North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven- continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the Americas. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six- continent models. This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.

 The criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of10,180,000 square kilometres(3,930,000 sq mi), while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view-- in geology and geography-- that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six- continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism:`` In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country.(...).'' However, for historical and cultural reasons, the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.

 If continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro- Eurasia. This produces a four- continent model consisting of Afro- Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.

 When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges. At those times Australia-- New Guinea was a single, continuous continent. Likewise the Americas and Afro- Eurasia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro- Eurasia- America, Antarctica, and Australia- New Guinea.

 Number

 There are several ways of distinguishing the continents:

 Models Color- coded map showing the various continents. Similar shades exhibit areas that may be consolidated or subdivided. Four continents Afro- Eurasia America Antarctica Australia Five continents Africa Eurasia America Antarctica Australia Six continents Africa Asia Europe America Antarctica Australia Six continents Africa Eurasia North America South America Antarctica Australia/ Oceania Seven continents Africa Asia Europe North America South America Antarctica Australia/ Oceania The seven- continent model is usually taught in China, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, parts of Western Europe and most English- speaking countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom. The six- continent combined- Eurasia model is mostly used in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Japan. The six- continent combined- America model is often used in France and its former possessions, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, Latin America, and Greece. A five- continent model is obtained from this model by excluding Antarctica as uninhabited. This is used, for example in the United Nations and in the Olympic Charter in its description of the Olympic flag. The term Oceania refers to a group of island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean, together with the continent of Australia. Pacific islands with ties to other continents( such as Japan, Hawaii or Easter Island) are usually grouped with those continents rather than Oceania. This term is used in several different continental models instead of Australia.

 Other divisions

 Supercontinents

 Aside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term continent varies. Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core. These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, and Pangaea.

 Subcontinents

 Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula. The southern cone of South America and Alaskan peninsula of North America are other examples.

 In many of these cases, the`` subcontinents'' concerned are on different tectonic plates from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology. Greenland, generally reckoned as the world's largest island on the northeastern periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent. This is a significant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent.

 Where the Americas are viewed as a single continent( America), it is divided into two subcontinents( North America and South America) or three( with Central America being the third). When Eurasia is regarded as a single continent, Europe is treated as a subcontinent.

 Submerged continents

 Some areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents. Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the sea primarily in New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the almost completely submerged Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean.

 Microcontinents

 Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered microcontinents. Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as`` the eighth continent'' from a biological perspective.

 Botanical continents

`` Botanical continents'' defined by the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions.`` Continents'' may be defined differently for specific purposes. The Biodiversity Information Standards organization has developed the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions, used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine`` botanical continents''. Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America( Mexico northwards) and Southern America( Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.

 History of continental configurations

 Main article: Geological history of the Earth History of the concept

 The Ancient Greek geographer Strabo holding a globe showing Europa and Asia Early concepts of the old world continents

 The term`` continent'' translates Greekἤπειρος, properly`` landmass, terra firma'', the proper name of Epirus and later especially used of Asia( i.e. Asia Minor), The first distinction between continents was made by ancient Greek mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus strait and the Black Sea. The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands. But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and``... beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia...''

 Ancient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa( then called Libya) should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate. From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south. The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, the Europe-- Asia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the Rioni River( known then as the Phasis) in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River( known then as the Tanais) in Russia. The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River. Herodotus in the5th century BC, however, objected to the unity of Egypt being split into Asia and Africa(`` Libya'') and took the boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the division into three of what is really a single landmass, a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.

 Eratosthenes, in the3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers( the Nile and the Don), thus considering them`` islands''. Others divided the continents by isthmuses, calling the continents`` peninsulas''. These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the Red Sea and the mouth of Lake Bardawil on the Mediterranean Sea.

 Medieval T and O map showing the three continents as domains of the sons of Noah-- Asia to Sem( Shem), Europe to Iafeth( Japheth), and Africa to Cham( Ham). Through the Roman period and the Middle Ages, a few writers took the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt( Gibbon). In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on T and O maps, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the18th century,`` the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus( the boundary between Egypt and Libya) farther west, had even then scarcely passed away''.

 European arrival in the Americas

 Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the Americas. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continent-- he always thought it was part of Asia.

 In1501, Amerigo Vespucci and Gonçalo Coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean, passing through Fernando de Noronha. After reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America, confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to. On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called Mundus Novus(`` New World''), was published under Vespucci's name in1502 or1503, although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer. Regardless of who penned the words, Mundus Novus credited Vespucci with saying,`` I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa'', the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.

 Within a few years the name`` New World'' began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana( Pesaro) map of around1504--1505. Maps of this time though, still showed North America connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.

 Universalis Cosmographia, Waldseemüller's1507 world map-- the first to show the Americas separate from Asia In1507 Martin Waldseemüller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named`` America'' after Amerigo Vespucci's first name. On the map, the word`` America'' was placed on part of South America.

 The word continent

 From the16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning continuous or connected land and translated from the Latin terra continens. The noun was used to mean`` a connected or continuous tract of land'' or mainland. It was not applied only to very large areas of land-- in the17th century, references were made to the continents( or mainlands) of Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales and in1745 to Sumatra. The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three`` parts'' of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.

 While continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that`` A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa.'' In1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclopædia,`` The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the old and the new.'' And in his1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as`` a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another.'' However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as`` parts'' of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.

 From the late18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the19th century.

 Europeans discovered Australia in1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth( or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent). In1813, Samuel Butler wrote of Australia as`` New Holland, an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent'' and the Oxford English Dictionary was just as equivocal some decades later.

 Antarctica was sighted in1820 during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition and described as a continent by Charles Wilkes on the United States Exploring Expedition in1838, the last continent identified, although a great`` Antarctic''( antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after World War II.

 From the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.

 From the1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents. With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven- continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to Latin Americans, who saw their region spanning an América as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains dominant, as it does in scattered other countries.

 Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia. In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.

 Geology

 This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.( May2015)( Learn how and when to remove this template message) Further information: Continental crust and Plate tectonics Geologists use the term continent in a different manner from geographers. In geology a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some geologists restrict the term' continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian`` shield'', typically1.5 to3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts( mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break- up from plate tectonic activity. An outward- thickening veneer of younger, minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate- tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are`` high and dry''; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.

 The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans Some argue that continents are accretionary crustal`` rafts'' that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas( i.e. East European craton and Indian craton). Younger mobile belts( such as the Ural Mountains and Himalayas) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.

 There are many microcontinents, or continental fragments, that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent, whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continent-- only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.

 Plate tectonics offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified Eurasian Plate, which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent Himalaya mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland( a portion of the Canadian Shield), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian land mass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions(`` continental rocks,''`` plate boundaries'') are used as appropriate.

 The movement of plates has caused the formation and break- up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of2.0--1.8 billion years ago and broke up about1.5--1.3 billion years ago. The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around600 million years ago. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia( which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana( which became the remaining continents).

The lowest non-submarine bedrock elevations in these continents are the trough beneath Jakobshavn Glacier(−1,512 metres(−4,961 ft)) and Bentley Subglacial Trench(−2,540 metres(−8,330 ft)), but these are covered by kilometers of ice.

 Some sources list the Kuma-- Manych Depression( a remnant of the Paratethys) as the geological border between Europe and Asia. This would place the Caucasus outside of Europe, thus making Mont Blanc( elevation4810 m) in the Graian Alps the highest point in Europe- the lowest point would still be the shore of the Caspian Sea.

 Jump to: navigation, search For any other use, see Crust( disambiguation). The internal structure of Earth In geology, the crust is the outermost solid shell of a rocky planet, dwarf planet, or natural satellite. It is usually distinguished from the underlying mantle by its chemical makeup; however, in the case of icy satellites, it may be distinguished based on its phase( solid crust vs. liquid mantle).

 The crusts of Earth, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Io, and other planetary bodies formed via igneous processes, and were later modified by erosion, impact cratering, volcanism, and sedimentation.

 Most terrestrial planets have fairly uniform crusts. Earth, however, has two distinct types: continental crust and oceanic crust. These two types have different chemical compositions and physical properties, and were formed by different geological processes.

 Types of crust

 Planetary geologists divide crust into three categories, based on how and when they formed.

 Primary crust/ primordial crust

 This is a planet's`` original'' crust. It forms from solidification of a magma ocean. Toward the end of planetary accretion, the terrestrial planets likely had surfaces that were magma oceans. As these cooled, they solidified into crust. This crust was likely destroyed by large impacts and re-formed many times as the Era of Heavy Bombardment drew to a close.

 The nature of primary crust is still debated: its chemical, mineralogic, and physical properties are unknown, as are the igneous mechanisms that formed them. This is because it is difficult to study: none of Earth's primary crust has survived to today. Earth's high rates of erosion and crustal recycling from plate tectonics has destroyed all rocks older than about4 billion years, including whatever primary crust Earth once had.

 However, geologists can glean information about primary crust by studying it on other terrestrial planets. Mercury's highlands might represent primary crust, though this is debated. The anorthosite highlands of the Moon are primary crust, formed as plagioclase crystallized out of the Moon's initial magma ocean and floated to the top; however, it is unlikely that Earth followed a similar pattern, as the Moon was a water-less system and Earth had water. The Martian meteorite ALH84001 might represent primary crust of Mars; however, again, this is debated. Like Earth, Venus lacks primary crust, as the entire planet has been repeatedly resurfaced and modified.

 Secondary crust

 Secondary crust is formed by partial melting of silicate materials in the mantle, and so is usually basaltic in composition.

 This is the most common type of crust in the Solar System. Most of the surfaces of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars comprise secondary crust, as do the lunar maria. On Earth, we see secondary crust forming primarily at mid-ocean spreading centers, where the adiabatic rise of mantle causes partial melting.

 Tertiary crust

 Tertiary crust is more chemically- modified than either primary or secondary. It can form in several ways:

 Igneous processes: partial- melting of secondary crust, coupled with differentiation or dehydration Erosion and sedimentation: sediments derived from primary, secondary, or tertiary crust The only known example of tertiary crust is the continental crust of the Earth. It is unknown whether other terrestrial planets can be said to have tertiary crust, though the evidence so far suggests that they do not. This is likely because plate tectonics is needed to create tertiary crust, and Earth is the only planet in our Solar System with plate tectonics.

 Earth's crust

 Structure

 Plates in the crust of Earth The crust is a thin shell on the outside of the Earth, accounting for less than1% of Earth's volume. It is the top component of lithosphere: a division of Earth's layers that includes the crust and the upper part of the mantle. The lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates that move, allowing heat to escape from the interior of the Earth into space.

 The crust lies on top of the mantle, a configuration that is stable because the upper mantle is made of peridotite and so is significantly denser than the crust. The boundary between the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the Mohorovičić discontinuity, a boundary defined by a contrast in seismic velocity.

 Geologic provinces of the World( USGS) Shield Platform Orogen Basin Large igneous province Extended crust Oceanic crust:0--20 Ma20--65 Ma>65 Ma The crust of the Earth is of two distinctive types:

 Oceanic:5 km(3 mi) to10 km(6 mi) thick and composed primarily of denser, more mafic rocks, such as basalt, diabase, and gabbro. Continental:30 km(20 mi) to50 km(30 mi) thick and mostly composed of less dense, more felsic rocks, such as granite. Because both continental and oceanic crust are less dense than the mantle below, both types of crust`` float'' on the mantle. This is isostasy, and it's also one of the reasons continental crust is higher than oceanic: continental is less dense and so`` floats'' higher. As a result, water pools in above the oceanic crust, forming the oceans.

 The temperature of the crust increases with depth, reaching values typically in the range from about200° C(392° F) to400° C(752° F) at the boundary with the underlying mantle. The temperature increases by as much as30° C(54° F) for every kilometer locally in the upper part of the crust, but the geothermal gradient is smaller in deeper crust.

 Composition

 Main articles: Abundance of elements in Earth's crust and Goldschmidt classification Abundance( atom fraction) of the chemical elements in Earth's upper continental crust as a function of atomic number. The rarest elements in the crust( shown in yellow) are not the heaviest, but are rather the siderophile( iron- loving) elements in the Goldschmidt classification of elements. These have been depleted by being relocated deeper into Earth's core. Their abundance in meteoroid materials is higher. Additionally, tellurium and selenium have been depleted from the crust due to formation of volatile hydrides. The continental crust has an average composition similar to that of andesite. The most abundant minerals in Earth's continental crust are feldspars, which make up about41% of the crust by weight, followed by quartz at12%, and pyroxenes at11%. Continental crust is enriched in incompatible elements compared to the basaltic ocean crust and much enriched compared to the underlying mantle. Although the continental crust comprises only about0.6 weight percent of the silicate on Earth, it contains20% to70% of the incompatible elements.

Estimates of average density for the upper crust range between2.69 and2.74 g/ cm and for lower crust between3.0 and3.25 g/ cm.

 Formation and evolution

 Main article: Formation of the Earth Earth formed approximately4.6 billion years ago from a disk of dust and gas orbiting the newly formed Sun. It formed via accretion, where planetesimals and other smaller rocky bodies collided and stuck, gradually growing into a planet. This process generated an enormous amount of heat, which caused early Earth to melt completely. As planetary accretion slowed, Earth began to cool, forming its first crust, called a primary or primordial crust. This crust was likely repeatedly destroyed by large impacts, then reformed from the magma ocean left by the impact. None of Earth's primary crust has survived to today; all was destroyed by erosion, impacts, and plate tectonics over the past several billion years.

 Since then, Earth has been forming secondary and tertiary crust. Secondary crust forms at mid-ocean spreading centers, where partial- melting of the underlying mantle yields basaltic magmas and new ocean crust forms. This`` ridge push'' is one of the driving forces of plate tectonics, and it is constantly creating new ocean crust. That means that old crust must be destroyed somewhere, so, opposite a spreading center, there is usually a subduction zone: a trench where an ocean plate is being shoved back into the mantle. This constant process of creating new ocean crust and destroying old ocean crust means that the oldest ocean crust on Earth today is only about200 million years old.

 In contrast, the bulk of the continental crust is much older. The oldest continental crustal rocks on Earth have ages in the range from about3.7 to4.28 billion years and have been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane in Western Australia, in the Acasta Gneiss in the Northwest Territories on the Canadian Shield, and on other cratonic regions such as those on the Fennoscandian Shield. Some zircon with age as great as4.3 billion years has been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane.

 The average age of the current Earth's continental crust has been estimated to be about2.0 billion years. Most crustal rocks formed before2.5 billion years ago are located in cratons. Such old continental crust and the underlying mantle asthenosphere are less dense than elsewhere in Earth and so are not readily destroyed by subduction. Formation of new continental crust is linked to periods of intense orogeny; these periods coincide with the formation of the supercontinents such as Rodinia, Pangaea and Gondwana. The crust forms in part by aggregation of island arcs including granite and metamorphic fold belts, and it is preserved in part by depletion of the underlying mantle to form buoyant lithospheric mantle.

 Moon's crust

 Main article: Geology of the Moon A theoretical protoplanet named`` Theia'' is thought to have collided with the forming Earth, and part of the material ejected into space by the collision accreted to form the Moon. As the Moon formed, the outer part of it is thought to have been molten, a`` lunar magma ocean.'' Plagioclase feldspar crystallized in large amounts from this magma ocean and floated toward the surface. The cumulate rocks form much of the crust. The upper part of the crust probably averages about88% plagioclase( near the lower limit of90% defined for anorthosite): the lower part of the crust may contain a higher percentage of ferromagnesian minerals such as the pyroxenes and olivine, but even that lower part probably averages about78% plagioclase. The underlying mantle is denser and olivine- rich.

 The thickness of the crust ranges between about20 and120 km. Crust on the far side of the Moon averages about12 km thicker than that on the near side. Estimates of average thickness fall in the range from about50 to60 km. Most of this plagioclase- rich crust formed shortly after formation of the moon, between about4.5 and4.3 billion years ago. Perhaps10% or less of the crust consists of igneous rock added after the formation of the initial plagioclase- rich material. The best- characterized and most voluminous of these later additions are the mare basalts formed between about3.9 and3.2 billion years ago. Minor volcanism continued after3.2 billion years, perhaps as recently as1 billion years ago. There is no evidence of plate tectonics.

 Study of the Moon has established that a crust can form on a rocky planetary body significantly smaller than Earth. Although the radius of the Moon is only about a quarter that of Earth, the lunar crust has a significantly greater average thickness. This thick crust formed almost immediately after formation of the Moon. Magmatism continued after the period of intense meteorite impacts ended about3.9 billion years ago, but igneous rocks younger than3.9 billion years make up only a minor part of the crust.
