 Earth's orbit- wikipedia Earth's orbit

 Jump to: navigation, search The Earth at different points in its orbit Earth's orbit is the trajectory along which Earth travels around the Sun. The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is149.60 million km(92.96 million mi), and one complete orbit takes365.256 days(1 sidereal year), during which time Earth has traveled940 million km(584 million mi). Earth's orbit has an eccentricity of0.0167.

 As seen from Earth, the planet's orbital prograde motion makes the Sun appear to move with respect to other stars at a rate of about1°( or a Sun or Moon diameter every12 hours) eastward per solar day. Earth's orbital speed averages about30 km/ s(108,000 km/ h;67,000 mph), which is fast enough to cover the planet's diameter in7 minutes and the distance to the Moon in4 hours.

 From a vantage point above the north pole of either the Sun or Earth, Earth would appear to revolve in a counter clockwise direction around the Sun. From the same vantage point, both the Earth and the Sun would appear to rotate also in a counterclockwise direction about their respective axes.

 History of study( edit)

 Main article: Heliocentrism Heliocentric Solar System Heliocentrism( lower panel) in comparison to the geocentric model( upper panel) Heliocentrism is the scientific model that first placed the Sun at the center of the Solar System and put the planets, including Earth, in its orbit. Historically, heliocentrism is opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. Aristarchus of Samos already proposed a heliocentric model in the3rd century BC. In the16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus' De revolutionibus presented a full discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as Ptolemy had presented his geocentric model in the2nd century. This`` Copernican revolution'' resolved the issue of planetary retrograde motion by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent.`` Although Copernicus's groundbreaking book... had been( printed) over a century earlier,( the Dutch mapmaker) Joan Blaeu was the first mapmaker to incorporate his revolutionary heliocentric theory into a map of the world.''

 Influence on Earth( edit)

 Main article: Season Because of Earth's axial tilt( often known as the obliquity of the ecliptic), the inclination of the Sun's trajectory in the sky( as seen by an observer on Earth's surface) varies over the course of the year. For an observer at a northern latitude, when the north pole is tilted toward the Sun the day lasts longer and the Sun appears higher in the sky. This results in warmer average temperatures, as additional solar radiation reaches the surface. When the north pole is tilted away from the Sun, the reverse is true and the weather is generally cooler. Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle, an extreme case is reached in which there is no daylight at all for part of the year. This is called a polar night. This variation in the weather( because of the direction of the Earth's axial tilt) results in the seasons.

 Events in the orbit( edit)

 By astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the solstices-- the two points in the Earth's orbit of the maximum tilt of the Earth's axis, towards the Sun or away from the Sun-- and the equinoxes-- the two points in the Earth's orbit where the Earth's tilted axis and an imaginary line drawn from the Earth to the Sun are exactly perpendicular to one another. The solstices and equinoxes divide the year up into four approximately equal parts. In the northern hemisphere winter solstice occurs on or about December21; summer solstice is near June21; spring equinox is around March20; and autumnal equinox is about September23. The effect of the Earth's axial tilt in the southern hemisphere is the opposite of that in the northern hemisphere, thus the seasons of the solstices and equinoxes in the southern hemisphere are the reverse of those in the northern hemisphere( e.g. the northern summer solstice is at the same time as the southern winter solstice).

 In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around January3, and the aphelion around July4( for other eras, see precession and Milankovitch cycles). The changing Earth-- Sun distance results in an increase of about6.9% in total solar energy reaching the Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Since the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that the Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. However, this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.

 The Hill sphere( gravitational sphere of influence) of the Earth is about1,500,000 kilometers(0.01 AU) in radius, or approximately4 times the average distance to the moon. This is the maximal distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects orbiting the Earth must be within this radius, otherwise they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

The orbital ellipse goes through each of the six Earth images, which are sequentially the perihelion( periapsis-- nearest point to the Sun) on anywhere from January2 to January5, the point of March equinox on March19,20, or21, the point of June solstice on June20,21, or22, the aphelion( apoapsis-- farthest point from the Sun) on anywhere from July3 to July5, the September equinox on September22,23, or24, and the December solstice on December21,22, or23. The diagram shows an exaggerated shape of Earth's orbit; the actual orbit is less eccentric than pictured.

 Because of the axial tilt of the Earth in its orbit, the maximal intensity of Sun rays hits the Earth23.4 degrees north of equator at the June Solstice( at the Tropic of Cancer), and23.4 degrees south of equator at the December Solstice( at the Tropic of Capricorn).

 Future( edit)

 Main article: Stability of the Solar System Mathematicians and astronomers( such as Laplace, Lagrange, Gauss, Poincaré, Kolmogorov, Vladimir Arnold, and Jürgen Moser) have searched for evidence for the stability of the planetary motions, and this quest led to many mathematical developments and several successive`` proofs'' of stability for the Solar System. By most predictions, Earth's orbit will be relatively stable over long periods.

 In1989, Jacques Laskar's work indicated that the Earth's orbit( as well as the orbits of all the inner planets) can become chaotic and that an error as small as15 meters in measuring the initial position of the Earth today would make it impossible to predict where the Earth would be in its orbit in just over100 million years' time. Modeling the Solar System is subject to the n- body problem.

 Jump up^ Our planet takes about365 days to orbit the Sun. A full orbit has360°. That fact demonstrates that each day, the Earth travels roughly1° in its orbit. Thus, the Sun will appear to move eastward across the sky relative to the stars by that same amount. Jump up^ For the Earth, the Hill radius is R H= a( m3 M)1/3,(\ displaystyle R_( H)= a\ left((\ frac( m)(3M))\ right)^(1/3),) where m is the mass of the Earth, a is an astronomical unit, and M is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in AU is about(13⋅332946)1/3≈0.01(\ displaystyle\ left((\ frac(1)(3\ cdot332\,946))\ right)^(1/3)\ approx0.01). Jump up^ All astronomical quantities vary, both secularly and periodically. The quantities given are the values at the instant J2000.0 of the secular variation, ignoring all periodic variations.^ Jump up to: aphelion= a×(1+ e); perihelion= a×(1-- e), where a is the semi-major axis and e is the eccentricity. Jump up^ The reference lists the longitude of perihelion, which is the sum of the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of perihelion. Subtracting from that(102.937°) the node longitude of174.873° gives−71.936°. Adding360° gives288.064°. That addition does not change the angle but expresses it in the usual0--360° range for longitudes. References( edit)
