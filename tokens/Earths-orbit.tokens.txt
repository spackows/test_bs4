 Abundance of elements in Earth's crust- wikipedia Abundance of elements in Earth's crust

 Jump to: navigation, search Abundance( atom fraction) of the chemical elements in Earth's upper continental crust as a function of atomic number. The rarest elements in the crust( shown in yellow) are not the heaviest, but are rather the siderophile( iron- loving) elements in the Goldschmidt classification of elements. These have been depleted by being relocated deeper into the Earth's core. Their abundance in meteoroids is higher. Additionally, tellurium and selenium have been depleted from the crust due to formation of volatile hydrides. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust is shown in tabulated form with the estimated crustal abundance for each chemical element shown as either percentage or parts per million( ppm) by mass(10,000 ppm=1%).

`` Air'' redirects here. For other uses, see Air( disambiguation).`` Qualities of air'' redirects here. It is not to be confused with Air quality.

 Blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere, surrounding Earth in a visibly blue layer when seen from space on board the ISS at an altitude of335 km(208 mi). Composition of Earth's atmosphere by volume. Lower pie represents trace gases that together compose about0.038% of the atmosphere(0.043% with CO at2014 concentration). Numbers are mainly from1987, with CO and methane from2009, and do not represent any single source. The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's gravity. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention( greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night( the diurnal temperature variation).

 By volume, dry air contains78.09% nitrogen,20.95% oxygen,0.93% argon,0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around1% at sea level, and0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air content and atmospheric pressure vary at different layers, and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere and in artificial atmospheres.

 The atmosphere has a mass of about5.15×10 kg, three quarters of which is within about11 km(6.8 mi;36,000 ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. The Kármán line, at100 km(62 mi), or1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around120 km(75 mi). Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.

 The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science( aerology). Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.

 Main article: Atmospheric chemistry Mean atmospheric water vapor The three major constituents of Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor( a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air( without water vapor). The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases, among which are the greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine( elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide( SO) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.

 Earth's atmosphere Lower4 layers of the atmosphere in3 dimensions as seen diagonally from above the exobase. Layers drawn to scale, objects within the layers are not to scale. Aurorae shown here at the bottom of the thermosphere can actually form at any altitude in this atmospheric layer. Principal layers

 In general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions( see the temperature section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/ altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided( called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:

 Exosphere:700 to10,000 km(440 to6,200 miles) Thermosphere:80 to700 km(50 to440 miles) Mesosphere:50 to80 km(31 to50 miles) Stratosphere:12 to50 km(7 to31 miles) Troposphere:0 to12 km(0 to7 miles) Exosphere Main article: Exosphere The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere( i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about700 km above sea level, to about10,000 km(6,200 mi;33,000,000 ft) where it merges into the solar wind.

 This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free- moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind.

 The exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the aurora borealis and aurora australis sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.

 Thermosphere Main article: Thermosphere The thermosphere is the second- highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause( which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about80 km(50 mi;260,000 ft) up to the thermopause at an altitude range of500--1000 km(310--620 mi;1,600,000--3,300,000 ft). The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity. Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from80 to550 kilometres(50 to342 mi) above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.

 The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature inversion is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as1500° C(2700° F), though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule( of oxygen, for example) travels an average of1 kilometre(0.62 mi;3300 ft) between collisions with other molecules. Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.

 This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between350 and420 km(220 and260 mi).

 Mesosphere Main article: Mesosphere The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about50 km(31 mi;160,000 ft) to the mesopause at80--85 km(50--53 mi;260,000--280,000 ft) above sea level.

 Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around−85° C(−120° F;190 K).

 Just below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar- mesospheric noctilucent clouds. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around4 to16 degrees below the horizon. Lightning- induced discharges known as transient luminous events( TLEs) occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet- powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket- powered aircraft.

 Stratosphere Main article: Stratosphere The stratosphere is the second- lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly12 km(7.5 mi;39,000 ft) above Earth's surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about50 to55 km(31 to34 mi;164,000 to180,000 ft).

 The atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly1/1000 the pressure at sea level. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation( UV) radiation from the Sun by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be−60° C(−76° F;210 K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near0° C.

 The stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather- producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet- powered aircraft.

 Troposphere Main article: Troposphere The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about12 km(7.5 mi;39,000 ft), although this altitude varies from about9 km(5.6 mi;30,000 ft) at the geographic poles to17 km(11 mi;56,000 ft) at the Equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion( i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is isothermal with height.

 Although variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere( i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing( hence, the origin of its name in the Greek wordτρόπος, tropos, meaning`` turn''). The troposphere contains roughly80% of the mass of Earth's atmosphere. The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower5.6 km(3.5 mi;18,000 ft) of the troposphere.

 Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather- associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller- driven aircraft.

The orange layer is the troposphere, which gives way to the whitish stratosphere and then the blue mesosphere. Other layers

 Within the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:

 The ozone layer is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer ozone concentrations are about2 to8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about15--35 km(9.3--21.7 mi;49,000--115,000 ft), though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere. The ionosphere is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. It is responsible for auroras. During daytime hours, it stretches from50 to1,000 km(31 to621 mi;160,000 to3,280,000 ft) and includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere. However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere. The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere. It has practical importance because it influences, for example, radio propagation on Earth. The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface- based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence. This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the turbopause found at about100 km(62 mi;330,000 ft), the very edge of space itself as accepted by the FAI, which places it about20 km(12 mi;66,000 ft) above the mesopause. Above this altitude lies the heterosphere, which includes the exosphere and most of the thermosphere. Here, the chemical composition varies with altitude. This is because the distance that particles can move without colliding with one another is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only near the bottom of the heterosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element. The planetary boundary layer is the part of the troposphere that is closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through turbulent diffusion. During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well- mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about100 metres(330 ft) on clear, calm nights to3,000 m(9,800 ft) or more during the afternoon in dry regions. The average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is14° C(57° F;287 K) or15° C(59° F;288 K), depending on the reference.

 Physical properties

 Comparison of the1962 US Standard Atmosphere graph of geometric altitude against air density, pressure, the speed of sound and temperature with approximate altitudes of various objects. Pressure and thickness

 Main article: Atmospheric pressure The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International Standard Atmosphere as101325 pascals(760.00 Torr;14.6959 psi;760.00 mmHg). This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres( atm). Total atmospheric mass is5.1480×10 kg(1.135×10 lb), about2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and weather.

 If the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of8.50 km(27,900 ft). It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every5.6 km(18,000 ft) or by a factor of1/ e every7.64 km(25,100 ft), the average scale height of the atmosphere below70 km(43 mi;230,000 ft). However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.

 In summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:

50% is below5.6 km(18,000 ft).90% is below16 km(52,000 ft).99.99997% is below100 km(62 mi;330,000 ft), the Kármán line. By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered astronauts. By comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at8,848 m(29,029 ft); commercial airliners typically cruise between10 and13 km(33,000 and43,000 ft) where the thinner air improves fuel economy; weather balloons reach30.4 km(100,000 ft) and above; and the highest X-15 flight in1963 reached108.0 km(354,300 ft).

 Even above the Kármán line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur. Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below100 km and extend beyond500 km. By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at350--400 km, within the F- layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as700--800 km.

 Temperature and speed of sound

 Main articles: Atmospheric temperature and Speed of sound Temperature trends in two thick layers of the atmosphere as measured between January1979 and December2005 by Microwave Sounding Units and Advanced Microwave Sounding Units on NOAA weather satellites. The instruments record microwaves emitted from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. Source: The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above11 km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the stratosphere, starting above about20 km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly- named thermosphere above90 km.

 Because in an ideal gas of constant composition the speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile( see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.

 Density and mass

 Temperature and mass density against altitude from the NRLMSISE-00 standard atmosphere model( the eight dotted lines in each`` decade'' are at the eight cubes8,27,64,...,729) Main article: Density of air The density of air at sea level is about1.2 kg/ m(1.2 g/ L,0.0012 g/ cm). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air( a form of the ideal gas law). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.

 The average mass of the atmosphere is about5 quadrillion(5×10) tonnes or1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research,`` The total mean mass of the atmosphere is5.1480×10 kg with an annual range due to water vapor of1.2 or1.5×10 kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as1.27×10 kg and the dry air mass as5.1352±0.0003×10 kg.''

Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we can not see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.

 Scattering

 Main article: Scattering When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you can not see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter( blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer( red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.

 Absorption

 Main article: Absorption( electromagnetic radiation) Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric transmittance( or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light. Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O and O absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than300 nanometers. Water( H O) absorbs many wavelengths above700 nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.

 The combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave`` windows'' of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The optical window runs from around300 nm( ultraviolet- C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum( commonly called light), at roughly400--700 nm and continues to the infrared to around1100 nm. There are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven- meter waves.

 Emission

 Main article: Emission( electromagnetic radiation) Emission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their`` black body'' emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately6,000 K(5,730° C;10,340° F), its radiation peaks near500 nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately290 K(17° C;62° F), so its radiation peaks near10,000 nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.

 Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds( H O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.

 The greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are CO and H O.

 Refractive index

 See also: Scintillation( astronomy) The refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth's surface.

 The refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the mirage.

 Circulation

 Main article: Atmospheric circulation An idealised view of three large circulation cells. Atmospheric circulation is the large- scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means( with ocean circulation) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large- scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.

 Evolution of Earth's atmosphere

 See also: History of Earth and Paleoclimatology Earliest atmosphere

 The first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants( Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia.

 Second atmosphere

 Outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases. A major part of carbon- dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments. Water- related sediments have been found that date from as early as3.8 billion years ago.

 About3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable`` second atmosphere''. The influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life- forms appear as early as3.5 billion years ago. How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the`` faint young Sun paradox''.

 The geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth-- with the exception of one cold glacial phase about2.4 billion years ago. In the late Archean Eon an oxygen- containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing cyanobacteria( see Great Oxygenation Event), which have been found as stromatolite fossils from2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy( isotope ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as4 billion years ago.

 Ancient sediments in the Gabon dating from between about2,150 and2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion.

 Third atmosphere

 Oxygen content of the atmosphere over the last billion years The constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long- term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations.

 Before this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen. This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere. O showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than15% by the end of the Precambrian. The following time span from541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon, during the earliest period of which, the Cambrian, oxygen- requiring metazoan life forms began to appear.

 The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last600 million years, reaching a peak of about30% around280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen. Breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains21% oxygen, which is great enough for this rapid development of animals.

 Air pollution

 Main article: Air pollution Air pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms. Stratospheric ozone depletion is caused by air pollution, chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone- depleting substances.

 The scientific consensus is that the anthropogenic greenhouse gases currently accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of global warming.

Following the peak in vegetation, the drawdown of atmospheric CO due to photosynthesis is apparent, particularly over the boreal forests. Images from space

 On October19,2015 NASA started a website containing daily images of the full sunlit side of Earth on http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/. The images are taken from the Deep Space Climate Observatory( DSCOVR) and show Earth as it rotates during a day.

 Blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere, giving Earth a blue halo when seen from space. The geomagnetic storms cause beautiful displays of aurora across the atmosphere. Limb view, of Earth's atmosphere. Colors roughly denote the layers of the atmosphere. This image shows the Moon at the centre, with the limb of Earth near the bottom transitioning into the orange- colored troposphere. The troposphere ends abruptly at the tropopause, which appears in the image as the sharp boundary between the orange- and blue- colored atmosphere. The silvery- blue noctilucent clouds extend far above Earth's troposphere. Earth's atmosphere backlit by the Sun in an eclipse observed from deep space onboard Apollo12 in1969. See also

 Jump to: navigation, search This article is about the astronomical concept. For precession of the axes outside of astronomy, see Precession. For other types of astronomical precession, see Precession§ Astronomy. Precessional movement of Earth. Earth rotates( white arrows) once a day around its rotational axis( red); this axis itself rotates slowly( white circle), completing a rotation in approximately26,000 years In astronomy, axial precession is a gravity- induced, slow, and continuous change in the orientation of an astronomical body's rotational axis. In particular, it can refer to the gradual shift in the orientation of Earth's axis of rotation, which, similar to a wobbling top, traces out a pair of cones joined at their apices in a cycle of approximately26,000 years. The term`` precession'' typically refers only to this largest part of the motion; other changes in the alignment of Earth's axis-- nutation and polar motion-- are much smaller in magnitude.

 Earth's precession was historically called the precession of the equinoxes, because the equinoxes moved westward along the ecliptic relative to the fixed stars, opposite to the yearly motion of the Sun along the ecliptic. This term is still used in non-technical discussions, that is, when detailed mathematics are absent. Historically, the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes is usually attributed in the west to the Hellenistic- era( second- century BCE) astronomer, Hipparchus, although there are claims of its earlier discovery, such as in the Indian text, Vedanga Jyotisha, dating from700 BC. With improvements in the ability to calculate the gravitational force between and among planets during the first half of the nineteenth century, it was recognized that the ecliptic itself moved slightly, which was named planetary precession, as early as1863, while the dominant component was named lunisolar precession. Their combination was named general precession, instead of precession of the equinoxes.

 Lunisolar precession is caused by the gravitational forces of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge, causing Earth's axis to move with respect to inertial space. Planetary precession( an advance) is due to the small angle between the gravitational force of the other planets on Earth and its orbital plane( the ecliptic), causing the plane of the ecliptic to shift slightly relative to inertial space. Lunisolar precession is about500 times greater than planetary precession. In addition to the Moon and Sun, the other planets also cause a small movement of Earth's axis in inertial space, making the contrast in the terms lunisolar versus planetary misleading, so in2006 the International Astronomical Union recommended that the dominant component be renamed the precession of the equator, and the minor component be renamed precession of the ecliptic, but their combination is still named general precession. Many references to the old terms exist in publications predating the change.

 Precession nomenclature( edit)

 Etymologically,`` precession'' and`` procession'' are both terms that relate to motion.`` Precession'' is derived from the Latin praecedere,`` to precede, to come before or earlier''), while`` procession'' is derived from the Latin procedere,`` to march forward, to advance''). Generally the term`` procession'' is used to describe a group of objects moving forward. The stars viewed from Earth are seen to proceed in a procession from east to west daily, due to the Earth's diurnal motion, and yearly, due to the Earth's revolution around the Sun. At the same time the stars can be observed to anticipate slightly such motion, at the rate of approximately50 arc seconds per year, a phenomenon known as the`` precession of the equinoxes''.

 In describing this motion astronomers generally have shortened the term to simply`` precession''. In describing the cause of the motion physicists have also used the term`` precession'', which has led to some confusion between the observable phenomenon and its cause, which matters because in astronomy, some precessions are real and others are apparent. This issue is further obfuscated by the fact that many astronomers are physicists or astrophysicists.

 It should be noted that the term`` precession'' used in astronomy generally describes the observable precession of the equinox( the stars moving retrograde across the sky), whereas the term`` precession'' as used in physics, generally describes a mechanical process.

 Effects( edit)

 The coincidence of the annual cycles of the apses( closest and further approach to the sun) and calendar dates( with seasons noted) at four equally spaced stages of precessionary26,000- year- cycle. The season dates are those in the north. The tilt of Earth's axis and the eccentricity of its orbit are exaggerated. Approximate estimates. Effects of weak planetary precession on the stages shown are ignored. The precession of the Earth's axis has a number of observable effects. First, the positions of the south and north celestial poles appear to move in circles against the space- fixed backdrop of stars, completing one circuit in approximately26,000 years. Thus, while today the star Polaris lies approximately at the north celestial pole, this will change over time, and other stars will become the`` north star''. In approximately3200 years, the star Gamma Cephei in the Cepheus constellation will succeed Polaris for this position. The south celestial pole currently lacks a bright star to mark its position, but over time precession also will cause bright stars to become south stars. As the celestial poles shift, there is a corresponding gradual shift in the apparent orientation of the whole star field, as viewed from a particular position on Earth.

 Secondly, the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun at the solstices, equinoxes, or other time defined relative to the seasons, slowly changes. For example, suppose that the Earth's orbital position is marked at the summer solstice, when the Earth's axial tilt is pointing directly toward the Sun. One full orbit later, when the Sun has returned to the same apparent position relative to the background stars, the Earth's axial tilt is not now directly toward the Sun: because of the effects of precession, it is a little way`` beyond'' this. In other words, the solstice occurred a little earlier in the orbit. Thus, the tropical year, measuring the cycle of seasons( for example, the time from solstice to solstice, or equinox to equinox), is about20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year, which is measured by the Sun's apparent position relative to the stars. After about26000 years the difference amounts to a full year, so the positions of the seasons relative to the orbit are`` back where they started''.( Other effects also slowly change the shape and orientation of the Earth's orbit, and these, in combination with precession, create various cycles of differing periods; see also Milankovitch cycles. The magnitude of the Earth's tilt, as opposed to merely its orientation, also changes slowly over time, but this effect is not attributed directly to precession.)

 For identical reasons, the apparent position of the Sun relative to the backdrop of the stars at some seasonally fixed time slowly regresses a full360° through all twelve traditional constellations of the zodiac, at the rate of about50.3 seconds of arc per year, or1 degree every71.6 years.

 At present, the rate of precession corresponds to a period of25,772 years, but the rate itself varies somewhat with time( see Values below), so one can not say that in exactly25,772 years the earth's axis will be back to where it is now.

 For further details, see Changing pole stars and Polar shift and equinoxes shift, below.

 History( edit)

 Hellenistic World( edit)

 Hipparchus( edit) Though there is still- controversial evidence that Aristarchus of Samos possessed distinct values for the sidereal and tropical years as early as c.280 BC, the discovery of precession usually is attributed to Hipparchus(190--120 BC) of Rhodes or Nicaea, a Greek astronomer. According to Ptolemy's Almagest, Hipparchus measured the longitude of Spica and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, Timocharis(320--260 BC) and Aristillus(~280 BC), he concluded that Spica had moved2° relative to the autumnal equinox. He also compared the lengths of the tropical year( the time it takes the Sun to return to an equinox) and the sidereal year( the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving(`` precessing'') through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than1° in a century, in other words, completing a full cycle in no more than36000 years.

 Virtually all of the writings of Hipparchus are lost, including his work on precession. They are mentioned by Ptolemy, who explains precession as the rotation of the celestial sphere around a motionless Earth. It is reasonable to presume that Hipparchus, similarly to Ptolemy, thought of precession in geocentric terms as a motion of the heavens, rather than of the Earth.

 Ptolemy( edit) The first astronomer known to have continued Hipparchus's work on precession is Ptolemy in the second century AD. Ptolemy measured the longitudes of Regulus, Spica, and other bright stars with a variation of Hipparchus's lunar method that did not require eclipses. Before sunset, he measured the longitudinal arc separating the Moon from the Sun. Then, after sunset, he measured the arc from the Moon to the star. He used Hipparchus's model to calculate the Sun's longitude, and made corrections for the Moon's motion and its parallax( Evans1998, pp.251--255). Ptolemy compared his own observations with those made by Hipparchus, Menelaus of Alexandria, Timocharis, and Agrippa. He found that between Hipparchus's time and his own( about265 years), the stars had moved2°40', or1° in100 years(36'' per year; the rate accepted today is about50'' per year or1° in72 years). He also confirmed that precession affected all fixed stars, not just those near the ecliptic, and his cycle had the same period of36,000 years as found by Hipparchus.

 Other authors( edit) Most ancient authors did not mention precession and, perhaps, did not know of it. For instance, Proclus rejected precession, while Theon of Alexandria, a commentator on Ptolemy in the fourth century, accepted Ptolemy's explanation. Theon also reports an alternate theory:

 According to certain opinions ancient astrologers believe that from a certain epoch the solstitial signs have a motion of8° in the order of the signs, after which they go back the same amount...( Dreyer1958, p.204) Instead of proceeding through the entire sequence of the zodiac, the equinoxes`` trepidated'' back and forth over an arc of8°. The theory of trepidation is presented by Theon as an alternative to precession.

 Alternative discovery theories( edit)

 Babylonians( edit) Various assertions have been made that other cultures discovered precession independently of Hipparchus. According to Al- Battani, the Chaldean astronomers had distinguished the tropical and sidereal year so that by approximately330 BC, they would have been in a position to describe precession, if inaccurately, but such claims generally are regarded as unsupported.

 Maya( edit) The archaeologist Susan Milbrath has speculated that the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar of``30,000 years involving the Pleiades... may have been an effort to calculate the precession of the equinox.'' This view is held by few other professional scholars of Mayan civilization.

 Ancient Egyptians( edit) Similar claims have been made that precession was known in Ancient Egypt during the dynastic era, prior to the time of Hipparchus( Ptolemaic period). However, these claims remain controversial. Some buildings in the Karnak temple complex, for instance, allegedly were oriented toward the point on the horizon where certain stars rose or set at key times of the year. Nonetheless, they kept accurate calendars and if they recorded the date of the temple reconstructions it would be a fairly simple matter to plot the rough precession rate. The Dendera Zodiac, a star- map from the Hathor temple at Dendera from a late( Ptolemaic) age, allegedly records precession of the equinoxes( Tompkins1971). In any case, if the ancient Egyptians knew of precession, their knowledge is not recorded as such in any of their surviving astronomical texts.

 Michael Rice wrote in his Egypt's Legacy,`` Whether or not the ancients knew of the mechanics of the Precession before its definition by Hipparchos the Bithynian in the second century BC is uncertain, but as dedicated watchers of the night sky they could not fail to be aware of its effects.''( p.128) Rice believes that`` the Precession is fundamental to an understanding of what powered the development of Egypt''( p.10), to the extent that`` in a sense Egypt as a nation- state and the king of Egypt as a living god are the products of the realisation by the Egyptians of the astronomical changes effected by the immense apparent movement of the heavenly bodies which the Precession implies.''( p.56). Rice says that`` the evidence that the most refined astronomical observation was practised in Egypt in the third millennium BC( and probably even before that date) is clear from the precision with which the Pyramids at Giza are aligned to the cardinal points, a precision which could only have been achieved by their alignment with the stars.''( p.31) The Egyptians also, says Rice, were`` to alter the orientation of a temple when the star on whose position it had originally been set moved its position as a consequence of the Precession, something which seems to have happened several times during the New Kingdom.''( p.170)

 Indian views( edit)

 Main article: Ayanamsa Indian astrologers were aware of axial precession since before the Common Era. Although many of the astronomical texts stored in Taxila were burnt during Muslim invasion of India, the classic astronomical text Suryasiddhanta survived and contains references about ayana movements. In a later commentary on Suryasiddhanta around twelfth century, Bhāskara II says:`` sampāt revolves negatively30000 times in a Kalpa of4320 million years according to Suryasiddhanta, while Munjāla and others say ayana moves forward199669 in a Kalpa, and one should combine the two, before ascertaining declension, ascensional difference, etc.'' Lancelot Wilkinson translated the last of these three verses in a too concise manner to convey the full meaning, and skipped the portion combine the two which the modern Hindu commentary has brought to the fore. According to the Hindu commentary, the final value of period of precession should be obtained by combining+199669 revolutions of ayana with−30000 revolutions of sampaat, to get+169669 per Kalpa, i.e. one revolution in25461 years, which is near the modern value of25771 years.

 Moreover, Munjāla's value gives a period of21636 years for ayana's motion, which is the modern value of precession when anomalistic precession also is taken into account. The latter has a period of136000 years now, but Bhāskar- II gives its value at144000 years(30000 in a Kalpa), calling it sampāt. Bhāskar- II did not give any name of the final term after combining the negative sampāt with the positive ayana. The value he gave indicates, however, that by ayana he meant precession on account of the combined influence of orbital and anomalistic precessions, and by sampāt he meant the anomalistic period, but defined it as equinox. His language is a bit confused, which he clarified in his own Vāsanābhāshya commentary Siddhānta Shiromani, by saying that Suryasiddhanta was not available and he was writing on the basis of hearsay. Bhāskar- II did not give his own opinion, he merely cited Suryasiddhanta, Munjāla, and unnamed`` others''.

 Extant Suryasiddhanta supports the notion of trepidation within a range of±27° at the rate of54'' per year according to traditional commentators, but Burgess opined that the original meaning must have been of a cyclical motion, for which he quoted the Suryasiddhanta mentioned by Bhāskar II.

 Chinese Astronomy( edit)

 Yu Xi( fourth century AD) was the first Chinese astronomer to mention precession. He estimated the rate of precession as1° in50 years( Pannekoek1961, p.92).

 Middle Ages and renaissance( edit)

 In medieval Islamic astronomy, precession was known based on Ptolemy's Almagest, and by observations that refined the value.

 Al- Battani, in his Zij Al- Sabi', after mentioning Hipparchus calculating precession, and Ptolemy's value of1 degree per100 solar years, says that he measured precession and found it to be on degree per66 solar years.

 Subsequently, Al- Sufi mentions the same values in his Book of Fixed Stars, that Ptolemy's value for precession is1 degree per100 solar years. He then quotes a different value from Zij Al Mumtahan, which was done during Al- Ma'mun's reign, as1 degree for every66 solar years. He also quotes the aforementioned Al- Battani's Zij Al- Sabi' as adjusting coordinates for stars by11 degrees and10 minutes of arc to account for the difference between Al- Battani's time and Ptolemy's.

 Later, the Zij- i Ilkhani compiled at the Maragheh observatory sets the precession of the equinoxes at51 arc seconds per annum, which is very close to the modern value of50.2 arc seconds.

 In the Middle Ages, Islamic and Latin Christian astronomers treated`` trepidation'' as a motion of the fixed stars to be added to precession. This theory is commonly attributed to the Arab astronomer Thabit ibn Qurra, but the attribution has been contested in modern times. Nicolaus Copernicus published a different account of trepidation in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium(1543). This work makes the first definite reference to precession as the result of a motion of the Earth's axis. Copernicus characterized precession as the third motion of the Earth.

 Modern period( edit)

 Over a century later precession was explained in Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica(1687), to be a consequence of gravitation( Evans1998, p.246). Newton's original precession equations did not work, however, and were revised considerably by Jean le Rond d'Alembert and subsequent scientists.

 Hipparchus's discovery( edit)

 Hipparchus gave an account of his discovery in On the Displacement of the Solsticial and Equinoctial Points( described in Almagest III.1 and VII.2). He measured the ecliptic longitude of the star Spica during lunar eclipses and found that it was about6° west of the autumnal equinox. By comparing his own measurements with those of Timocharis of Alexandria( a contemporary of Euclid, who worked with Aristillus early in the3rd century BC), he found that Spica's longitude had decreased by about2° in the meantime( exact years are not mentioned in Almagest). Also in VII.2, Ptolemy gives more precise observations of two stars, including Spica and concludes that in each case a2°:40' change occurred during128 BC and AD139( hence,1° per century or one full cycle in36000 years, that is, the precessional period of Hipparchus as reported by Ptolemy; cf. page328 in Toomer's translation of Almagest,1998 edition)). He also noticed this motion in other stars. He speculated that only the stars near the zodiac shifted over time. Ptolemy called this his`` first hypothesis''( Almagest VII.1), but did not report any later hypothesis Hipparchus might have devised. Hipparchus apparently limited his speculations, because he had only a few older observations, which were not very reliable.

 Why did Hipparchus need a lunar eclipse to measure the position of a star? The equinoctial points are not marked in the sky, so he needed the Moon as a reference point. Hipparchus already had developed a way to calculate the longitude of the Sun at any moment. A lunar eclipse happens during Full moon, when the Moon is in opposition. At the midpoint of the eclipse, the Moon is precisely180° from the Sun. Hipparchus is thought to have measured the longitudinal arc separating Spica from the Moon. To this value, he added the calculated longitude of the Sun, plus180° for the longitude of the Moon. He did the same procedure with Timocharis' data( Evans1998, p.251). Observations such as these eclipses, incidentally, are the main source of data about when Hipparchus worked, since other biographical information about him is minimal. The lunar eclipses he observed, for instance, took place on April21,146 BC, and March21,135 BC( Toomer1984, p.135 n.14).

 Hipparchus also studied precession in On the Length of the Year. Two kinds of year are relevant to understanding his work. The tropical year is the length of time that the Sun, as viewed from the Earth, takes to return to the same position along the ecliptic( its path among the stars on the celestial sphere). The sidereal year is the length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position with respect to the stars of the celestial sphere. Precession causes the stars to change their longitude slightly each year, so the sidereal year is longer than the tropical year. Using observations of the equinoxes and solstices, Hipparchus found that the length of the tropical year was365+1/4−1/300 days, or365.24667 days( Evans1998, p.209). Comparing this with the length of the sidereal year, he calculated that the rate of precession was not less than1° in a century. From this information, it is possible to calculate that his value for the sidereal year was365+1/4+1/144 days( Toomer1978, p.218). By giving a minimum rate he may have been allowing for errors in observation.

 To approximate his tropical year Hipparchus created his own lunisolar calendar by modifying those of Meton and Callippus in On Intercalary Months and Days( now lost), as described by Ptolemy in the Almagest III.1( Toomer1984, p.139). The Babylonian calendar used a cycle of235 lunar months in19 years since499 BC( with only three exceptions before380 BC), but it did not use a specified number of days. The Metonic cycle(432 BC) assigned6,940 days to these19 years producing an average year of365+1/4+1/76 or365.26316 days. The Callippic cycle(330 BC) dropped one day from four Metonic cycles(76 years) for an average year of365+1/4 or365.25 days. Hipparchus dropped one more day from four Callippic cycles(304 years), creating the Hipparchic cycle with an average year of365+1/4−1/304 or365.24671 days, which was close to his tropical year of365+1/4−1/300 or365.24667 days.

 We find Hipparchus's mathematical signatures in the Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient astronomical computer of the second century BC. The mechanism is based on a solar year, the Metonic Cycle, which is the period the Moon reappears in the same star in the sky with the same phase( full Moon appears at the same position in the sky approximately in19 years), the Callipic cycle( which is four Metonic cycles and more accurate), the Saros cycle and the Exeligmos cycles( three Saros cycles for the accurate eclipse prediction). The study of the Antikythera Mechanism proves that the ancients have been using very accurate calendars based on all the aspects of solar and lunar motion in the sky. In fact, the Lunar Mechanism which is part of the Antikythera Mechanism depicts the motion of the Moon and its phase, for a given time, using a train of four gears with a pin and slot device which gives a variable lunar velocity that is very close to the second law of Kepler, i.e. it takes into account the fast motion of the Moon at perigee and slower motion at apogee. This discovery proves that Hipparchus mathematics were much more advanced than Ptolemy describes in his books, as it is evident that he developed a good approximation of Kepler ́ s second law.

 Mithraic question( edit)

 This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.( September2017)( Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Mithraic Mysteries, colloquially also known as Mithraism, was a1st--4th century neo-platonic mystery cult of the Roman god Mithras. The near- total lack of written descriptions or scripture necessitates a reconstruction of beliefs and practices from the archaeological evidence, such as that found in Mithraic temples( in modern times called mithraea), which were real or artificial`` caves'' representing the cosmos. Until the1970s most scholars followed Franz Cumont in identifying Mithras as a continuation of the Persian god Mithra. Cumont's continuity hypothesis, and his concomitant theory that the astrological component was a late and unimportant accretion, is no longer followed. Today, the cult and its beliefs are recognized as a product of( Greco-) Roman thought, with an astrological component even more heavily pronounced than the already very astrology- centric Roman beliefs generally were. The details, however, are debated.

 As far as axial precession is concerned, one scholar of Mithraism, David Ulansey, has interpreted Mithras as a personification of the force responsible for precession( Ulansey,1989). He argues that the cult was a religious response to Hipparchus's discovery of precession, which-- from the ancient geocentric perspective-- amounted to the discovery that the entire cosmos( i.e., the outermost celestial sphere of the fixed stars) was moving in a previously unknown way. His analysis is based on the so- called`` tauroctony'': the image of Mithras killing a bull that was located in the central place in every Mithraic temple. In the standard tauroctony, Mithras and the bull are accompanied by a dog, a snake, a raven, and a scorpion. According to Ulansey, the tauroctony is a star chart. The bull is Taurus, a constellation of the zodiac. In the astrological age that preceded the time of Hipparchus, the vernal equinox had taken place when the Sun was in the constellation of Taurus, and during that previous epoch the constellations of Canis Minor( The Dog), Hydra( The Snake), Corvus( The Raven), and Scorpius( The Scorpion)-- i.e., the constellations that correspond to the animals depicted in the tauroctony-- all lay on the celestial equator( the location of which is shifted by the precession) and thus had privileged positions in the sky during that epoch. Mithras himself represents the constellation Perseus, which is located directly above Taurus the Bull: the same location occupied by Mithras in the tauroctony image. Mithras' killing of the Bull, by this reasoning, represented the power possessed by this new god to shift the entire cosmic structure, turning the cosmic sphere so that the location of the spring equinox left the constellation of Taurus( a transition symbolized by the killing of the Bull), and the Dog, Snake, Raven, and Scorpion likewise lost their privileged positions on the celestial equator.

 The iconography also contains two torch- bearing twins( Cautes and Cautopates) framing the bull- slaying image-- one holding a torch pointing up and the other a torch pointing down. These torch- bearers are sometimes depicted with one of them( torch up) holding or associated with a Bull and a tree with leaves, and the other( torch down) holding or associated with a Scorpion and a tree with fruit. Ulansey interprets these torch- bearers as representing the spring equinox( torch up, tree with leaves, Bull) and the autumm equinox( torch down, tree with fruit, Scorpion) in Taurus and Scorpius respectively, which is where the equinoxes were located during the preceding`` Age of Taurus'' symbolized in the tauroctony as a whole. Thus Ulansey concludes that Mithraic iconography was an`` astronomical code'' whose secret was the existence of a new cosmic divinity, unknown to those outside the cult, whose fundamental attribute was his ability to shift the structure of the entire cosmos and thereby to control the astrological forces believed at that time to determine human existence, thus giving him the power to grant his devotees success during life and salvation after death( i.e., a safe journey through the planetary spheres and a subsequent immortal existence in the realm of the stars).

 Changing pole stars( edit)

 Precession of Earth's axis around the north ecliptical pole A consequence of the precession is a changing pole star. Currently Polaris is extremely well suited to mark the position of the north celestial pole, as Polaris is a moderately bright star with a visual magnitude of2.1( variable), and it is located about one degree from the pole.

 The previous pole star was Kochab( Beta Ursae Minoris,β UMi,β Ursae Minoris), the brightest star in the bowl of the`` Little Dipper'', located16 degrees from Polaris. It held that role from1500 BC to AD500. It was not quite as accurate in its day as Polaris is today. Today, Kochab and its neighbor Pherkad are referred to as the`` Guardians of the Pole''( meaning Polaris).

 On the other hand, Thuban in the constellation Draco, which was the pole star in3000 BC, is much less conspicuous at magnitude3.67( one- fifth as bright as Polaris); today it is invisible in light- polluted urban skies.

 The brilliant Vega in the constellation Lyra is often touted as the best north star( it fulfilled that role around12,000 BC and will do so again around the year14,000); however, it never comes closer than5° to the pole.

 When Polaris becomes the north star again around27,800, due to its proper motion it then will be farther away from the pole than it is now, while in23,600 BC it came closer to the pole.

 Precession of Earth's axis around the south ecliptical pole It is more difficult to find the south celestial pole in the sky at this moment, as that area is a particularly bland portion of the sky, and the nominal south pole star is Sigma Octantis, which with magnitude5.5 is barely visible to the naked eye even under ideal conditions. That will change from the80th to the90th centuries, however, when the south celestial pole travels through the False Cross.

 This situation also is seen on a star map. The orientation of the south pole is moving toward the Southern Cross constellation. For the last2,000 years or so, the Southern Cross has pointed to the south celestial pole. As a consequence, the constellation is no longer visible from subtropical northern latitudes, as it was in the time of the ancient Greeks.

 Polar shift and equinoxes shift( edit)

 Precessional movement as seen from' outside' the celestial sphere The26,000- year cycle of precession as seen from near the Earth. The current north pole star is Polaris( top). In about8,000 years it will be the bright star Deneb( left), and in about12,000 years, Vega( left center). The Earth's rotation is not depicted to scale-- in this span of time, it should rotate over9 million times. The images above attempt to explain the relation between the precession of the Earth's axis and the shift in the equinoxes. These images show the position of the Earth's axis on the celestial sphere, a fictitious sphere which places the stars according to their position as seen from Earth, regardless of their actual distance. The first image shows the celestial sphere from the outside, with the constellations in mirror image. The second image shows the perspective of a near- Earth position as seen through a very wide angle lens( from which the apparent distortion arises).

 The rotation axis of the Earth describes, over a period of25,700 years, a small circle( blue) among the stars, centered on the ecliptic north pole( the blue E) and with an angular radius of about23.4°, an angle known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. The direction of precession is opposite to the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis. The orange axis was the Earth's rotation axis5,000 years ago, when it pointed to the star Thuban. The yellow axis, pointing to Polaris, marks the axis now.

 The equinoxes occur where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic( red line), that is, where the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the Sun and Earth.( Note that the term`` equinox'' here refers to a point on the celestial sphere so defined, rather than the moment in time when the Sun is overhead at the Equator, though the two meanings are related.) When the axis precesses from one orientation to another, the equatorial plane of the Earth( indicated by the circular grid around the equator) moves. The celestial equator is just the Earth's equator projected onto the celestial sphere, so it moves as the Earth's equatorial plane moves, and the intersection with the ecliptic moves with it. The positions of the poles and equator on Earth do not change, only the orientation of the Earth against the fixed stars.

 As seen from the orange grid,5,000 years ago, the vernal equinox was close to the star Aldebaran of Taurus. Now, as seen from the yellow grid, it has shifted( indicated by the red arrow) to somewhere in the constellation of Pisces.

 Still pictures like these are only first approximations, as they do not take into account the variable speed of the precession, the variable obliquity of the ecliptic, the planetary precession( which is a slow rotation of the ecliptic plane itself, presently around an axis located on the plane, with longitude174°.8764) and the proper motions of the stars.

 The precession of the equinoxes is caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and the Moon, and to a lesser extent other bodies, on the Earth. It was first explained by Sir Isaac Newton.

 Axial precession is similar to the precession of a spinning top. In both cases, the applied force is due to gravity. For a spinning top, this force tends to be almost parallel to the rotation axis. For the Earth, however, the applied forces of the Sun and the Moon are nearly perpendicular to the axis of rotation.

 The Earth is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid, with an equatorial diameter about43 kilometers larger than its polar diameter. Because of the Earth's axial tilt, during most of the year the half of this bulge that is closest to the Sun is off- center, either to the north or to the south, and the far half is off- center on the opposite side. The gravitational pull on the closer half is stronger, since gravity decreases with distance, so this creates a small torque on the Earth as the Sun pulls harder on one side of the Earth than the other. The axis of this torque is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the Earth's rotation so the axis of rotation precesses. If the Earth were a perfect sphere, there would be no precession.

 This average torque is perpendicular to the direction in which the rotation axis is tilted away from the ecliptic pole, so that it does not change the axial tilt itself. The magnitude of the torque from the Sun( or the Moon) varies with the gravitational object's alignment with the Earth's spin axis and approaches zero when it is orthogonal.

 Although the above explanation involved the Sun, the same explanation holds true for any object moving around the Earth, along or close to the ecliptic, notably, the Moon. The combined action of the Sun and the Moon is called the lunisolar precession. In addition to the steady progressive motion( resulting in a full circle in about25,700 years) the Sun and Moon also cause small periodic variations, due to their changing positions. These oscillations, in both precessional speed and axial tilt, are known as the nutation. The most important term has a period of18.6 years and an amplitude of9.2''.

 In addition to lunisolar precession, the actions of the other planets of the Solar System cause the whole ecliptic to rotate slowly around an axis which has an ecliptic longitude of about174° measured on the instantaneous ecliptic. This so- called planetary precession shift amounts to a rotation of the ecliptic plane of0.47 seconds of arc per year( more than a hundred times smaller than lunisolar precession). The sum of the two precessions is known as the general precession.

 Equations( edit)

 Tidal force on Earth due to the Sun, Moon, or a planet The tidal force on Earth due to a perturbing body( Sun, Moon or planet) is expressed by Newton's law of universal gravitation, whereby the gravitational force of the perturbing body on the side of Earth nearest is said to be greater than the gravitational force on the far side by an amount proportional to the difference in the cubes of the distances between the near and far sides. If the gravitational force of the perturbing body acting on the mass of the Earth as a point mass at the center of Earth( which provides the centripetal force causing the orbital motion) is subtracted from the gravitational force of the perturbing body everywhere on the surface of Earth, what remains may be regarded as the tidal force. This gives the paradoxical notion of a force acting away from the satellite but in reality it is simply a lesser force towards that body due to the gradient in the gravitational field. For precession, this tidal force can be grouped into two forces which only act on the equatorial bulge outside of a mean spherical radius. This couple can be decomposed into two pairs of components, one pair parallel to Earth's equatorial plane toward and away from the perturbing body which cancel each other out, and another pair parallel to Earth's rotational axis, both toward the ecliptic plane. The latter pair of forces creates the following torque vector on Earth's equatorial bulge:

 T→=3 G m r3( C− A) sin⁡δ cos⁡δ( sin⁡α− cos⁡α0)(\ displaystyle(\ overrightarrow( T))=(\ frac(3Gm)( r^(3)))( C-A)\ sin\ delta\ cos\ delta(\ begin( pmatrix)\ sin\ alpha\\-\ cos\ alpha\\0\ end( pmatrix))) where

 Gm= standard gravitational parameter of the perturbing body r= geocentric distance to the perturbing body C= moment of inertia around Earth's axis of rotation A= moment of inertia around any equatorial diameter of Earth C− A= moment of inertia of Earth's equatorial bulge( C> A)δ= declination of the perturbing body( north or south of equator)α= right ascension of the perturbing body( east from vernal equinox). The three unit vectors of the torque at the center of the Earth( top to bottom) are x on a line within the ecliptic plane( the intersection of Earth's equatorial plane with the ecliptic plane) directed toward the vernal equinox, y on a line in the ecliptic plane directed toward the summer solstice(90° east of x), and z on a line directed toward the north pole of the ecliptic.

 The value of the three sinusoidal terms in the direction of x( sinδ cosδ sinα) for the Sun is a sine squared waveform varying from zero at the equinoxes(0°,180°) to0.36495 at the solstices(90°,270°). The value in the direction of y( sinδ cosδ(− cosα)) for the Sun is a sine wave varying from zero at the four equinoxes and solstices to±0.19364( slightly more than half of the sine squared peak) halfway between each equinox and solstice with peaks slightly skewed toward the equinoxes(43.37°(−),136.63°(+),223.37°(−),316.63°(+)). Both solar waveforms have about the same peak- to- peak amplitude and the same period, half of a revolution or half of a year. The value in the direction of z is zero.

 The average torque of the sine wave in the direction of y is zero for the Sun or Moon, so this component of the torque does not affect precession. The average torque of the sine squared waveform in the direction of x for the Sun or Moon is:

 T x=32 G m a3(1− e2)3/2( C− A) sin⁡ε cos⁡ε(\ displaystyle T_( x)=(\ frac(3)(2))(\ frac( Gm)( a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)))( C-A)\ sin\ epsilon\ cos\ epsilon) where

 a(\ displaystyle a)= semimajor axis of Earth's( Sun's) orbit or Moon's orbit e= eccentricity of Earth's( Sun's) orbit or Moon's orbit and1/2 accounts for the average of the sine squared waveform, a3(1− e2)3/2(\ displaystyle a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)) accounts for the average distance cubed of the Sun or Moon from Earth over the entire elliptical orbit, andε(\ displaystyle\ epsilon\,\!)( the angle between the equatorial plane and the ecliptic plane) is the maximum value ofδ for the Sun and the average maximum value for the Moon over an entire18.6 year cycle.

 Precession is:

 dψ d t= T x Cω sin⁡ε(\ displaystyle(\ frac( d\ psi)( dt))=(\ frac( T_( x))( C\ omega\ sin\ epsilon))) whereω is Earth's angular velocity and Cω is Earth's angular momentum. Thus the first order component of precession due to the Sun is:

 dψ S d t=32( G m a3(1− e2)3/2) S(( C− A) C cos⁡εω) E(\ displaystyle(\ frac( d\ psi_( S))( dt))=(\ frac(3)(2))\ left((\ frac( Gm)( a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)))\ right)_( S)\ left((\ frac(( C-A))( C))(\ frac(\ cos\ epsilon)(\ omega))\ right)_( E)) whereas that due to the Moon is:

 dψ L d t=32( G m(1−1.5 sin2⁡ i) a3(1− e2)3/2) L(( C− A) C cos⁡εω) E(\ displaystyle(\ frac( d\ psi_( L))( dt))=(\ frac(3)(2))\ left((\ frac( Gm(1-1.5\ sin^(2) i))( a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)))\ right)_( L)\ left((\ frac(( C-A))( C))(\ frac(\ cos\ epsilon)(\ omega))\ right)_( E)) where i is the angle between the plane of the Moon's orbit and the ecliptic plane. In these two equations, the Sun's parameters are within square brackets labeled S, the Moon's parameters are within square brackets labeled L, and the Earth's parameters are within square brackets labeled E. The term(1−1.5 sin2⁡ i)(\ displaystyle(1-1.5\ sin^(2) i)) accounts for the inclination of the Moon's orbit relative to the ecliptic. The term( C− A)/ C is Earth's dynamical ellipticity or flattening, which is adjusted to the observed precession because Earth's internal structure is not known with sufficient detail. If Earth were homogeneous the term would equal its third eccentricity squared,

The solar equation is a good representation of precession due the Sun because Earth's orbit is close to an ellipse, being only slightly perturbed by the other planets. The lunar equation is not as good a representation of precession due to the Moon because the Moon's orbit is greatly distorted by the Sun and neither the radius nor the eccentricity is constant over the year.

 Values( edit)

 Simon Newcomb's calculation at the end of the19th century for general precession( p) in longitude gave a value of5,025.64 arcseconds per tropical century, and was the generally accepted value until artificial satellites delivered more accurate observations and electronic computers allowed more elaborate models to be calculated. Lieske developed an updated theory in1976, where p equals5,029.0966 arcseconds per Julian century. Modern techniques such as VLBI and LLR allowed further refinements, and the International Astronomical Union adopted a new constant value in2000, and new computation methods and polynomial expressions in2003 and2006; the accumulated precession is:

 p=5,028.796195× T+1.1054348× T+ higher order terms, in arcseconds, with T, the time in Julian centuries( that is,36,525 days) since the epoch of2000.

 The rate of precession is the derivative of that:

 p=5,028.796195+2.2108696× T+ higher order terms. The constant term of this speed(5,028.796195 arcseconds per century in above equation) corresponds to one full precession circle in25,771.57534 years( one full circle of360 degrees divided with5,028.796195 arcseconds per century) although some other sources put the value at25771.4 years, leaving a small uncertainty.

 The precession rate is not a constant, but is( at the moment) slowly increasing over time, as indicated by the linear( and higher order) terms in T. In any case it must be stressed that this formula is only valid over a limited time period. It is a polynomial expression centred on the J2000 datum, empirically fitted to observational data, not on a deterministic model of the solar system. It is clear that if T gets large enough( far in the future or far in the past), the T2 term will dominate and p will go to very large values. In reality, more elaborate calculations on the numerical model of the Solar System show that the precessional constants have a period of about41,000 years, the same as the obliquity of the ecliptic. Note that the constants mentioned here are the linear and all higher terms of the formula above, not the precession itself. That is,

 p= A+ BT+ CT+... is an approximation of

 p= a+ b sin(2πT/ P), where P is the41,000 year period. Theoretical models may calculate the constants( coefficients) corresponding to the higher powers of T, but since it is impossible for a( finite) polynomial to match a periodic function over all numbers, the difference in all such approximations will grow without bound as T increases. However, greater accuracy can be obtained over a limited time span by fitting a high enough order polynomial to observation data, rather than a necessarily imperfect dynamic numerical model. So for present flight trajectory calculations of artificial satellites and spacecraft, the polynomial method gives better accuracy. In that respect, the International Astronomical Union chose the best- developed available theory. For up to a few centuries in the past and the future, all formulas do not diverge very much. For up to a few thousand years in the past and the future, most agree to some accuracy. For eras farther out, discrepancies become too large-- the exact rate and period of precession may not be computed using these polynomials even for a single whole precession period.

 The precession of Earth's axis is a very slow effect, but at the level of accuracy at which astronomers work, it does need to be taken into account on a daily basis. Note that although the precession and the tilt of Earth's axis( the obliquity of the ecliptic) are calculated from the same theory and thus, are related to each other, the two movements act independently of each other, moving in opposite directions.

 Precession exhibits a secular decrease due to tidal dissipation from59``/ a to45''/ a( a= annum= Julian year) during the500 million year period centered on the present. After short- term fluctuations( tens of thousands of years) are averaged out, the long- term trend can be approximated by the following polynomials for negative and positive time from the present in``/ a, where T is in billions of Julian years( Ga):

 p=50.475838−26.368583T+21.890862T p=50.475838−27.000654T+15.603265T Precession will be greater than p by the small amount of+0.135052``/ a between+30 Ma and+130 Ma. The jump to this excess over p will occur in only20 Ma beginning now because the secular decrease in precession is beginning to cross a resonance in Earth's orbit caused by the other planets.

 According to Ward, when, in about1,500 million years, the distance of the Moon, which is continuously increasing from tidal effects, has increased from the current60.3 to approximately66.5 Earth radii, resonances from planetary effects will push precession to49,000 years at first, and then, when the Moon reaches68 Earth radii in about2,000 million years, to69,000 years. This will be associated with wild swings in the obliquity of the ecliptic as well. Ward, however, used the abnormally large modern value for tidal dissipation. Using the620- million year average provided by tidal rhythmites of about half the modern value, these resonances will not be reached until about3,000 and4,000 million years, respectively. However, due to the gradually increasing luminosity of the Sun, unless the atmosphere is artificially shielded, the oceans of the Earth will have vaporized before that time( about2,100 million years from now).

 Jump to: navigation, search`` Obliquity'' redirects here. For the book, see Obliquity( book). In astronomy, axial tilt, also known as obliquity, is the angle between an object's rotational axis and its orbital axis, or, equivalently, the angle between its equatorial plane and orbital plane. It differs from orbital inclination.

 At an obliquity of zero, the two axes point in the same direction; i.e., the rotational axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane. Earth's obliquity oscillates between22.1 and24.5 degrees on a41,000- year cycle; the earth's mean obliquity is currently23°26′12.9''( or23.43693°) and decreasing.

 Over the course of an orbit, the obliquity usually does not change considerably, and the orientation of the axis remains the same relative to the background stars. This causes one pole to be directed more toward the Sun on one side of the orbit, and the other pole on the other side-- the cause of the seasons on the Earth.

 Standards( edit)

 The positive pole of a planet is defined by the right- hand rule: if the fingers of the right hand are curled in the direction of the rotation then the thumb points to the positive pole. The axial tilt is defined as the angle between the direction of the positive pole and the normal to the orbital plane. The angles for Earth, Uranus and Venus are approximately23°,97°, and177° respectively.

 There are two standard methods of specifying tilt. The International Astronomical Union( IAU) defines the north pole of a planet as that which lies on Earth's north side of the invariable plane of the Solar System; under this system, Venus is tilted3° and spins retrograde, opposite that of most of the other planets.

 The IAU also uses the right- hand rule to define a positive pole for the purpose of determining orientation. Using this convention, Venus is tilted177°(`` upside down'').

 Earth( edit)

 Earth's axial tilt( obliquity) is currently about23.4°. Earth's orbital plane is known as the ecliptic plane, and Earth's tilt is known to astronomers as the obliquity of the ecliptic, being the angle between the ecliptic and the celestial equator on the celestial sphere. It is denoted by the Greek letterε.

 Earth currently has an axial tilt of about23.4°. This value remains about the same relative to a stationary orbital plane throughout the cycles of axial precession. But the ecliptic( i.e., Earth's orbit) moves due to planetary perturbations, and the obliquity of the ecliptic is not a fixed quantity. At present, it is decreasing at a rate of about47'' per century( see details in Short term below).

 History( edit)

 Earth's obliquity may have been reasonably accurately measured as early as1100 BC in India and China. The ancient Greeks had good measurements of the obliquity since about350 BC, when Pytheas of Marseilles measured the shadow of a gnomon at the summer solstice. About830 AD, the Caliph Al- Mamun of Baghdad directed his astronomers to measure the obliquity, and the result was used in the Arab world for many years. In1437, Ulugh Beg determined the Earth's axial tilt as23°30′17''(23.5047°).

 It was widely believed, during the Middle Ages, that both precession and Earth's obliquity oscillated around a mean value, with a period of672 years, an idea known as trepidation of the equinoxes. Perhaps the first to realize this was incorrect( during historic time) was Ibn al- Shatir in the fourteenth century and the first to realize that the obliquity is decreasing at a relatively constant rate was Fracastoro in1538. The first accurate, modern, western observations of the obliquity were probably those of Tycho Brahe from Denmark, about1584, although observations by several others, including al- Ma'mun, al- Tusi, Purbach, Regiomontanus, and Walther, could have provided similar information.

 Seasons( edit)

 Main article: Season Earth's axis remains tilted in the same direction with reference to the background stars throughout a year( regardless of where it is in its orbit). This means that one pole( and the associated hemisphere of Earth) will be directed away from the Sun at one side of the orbit, and half an orbit later( half a year later) this pole will be directed towards the Sun. This is the cause of Earth's seasons. Summer occurs in the Northern hemisphere when the north pole is directed toward the Sun. Variations in Earth's axial tilt can influence the seasons and is likely a factor in long- term climate change( also see Milankovitch cycles).

 Relationship between Earth's axial tilt(ε) to the tropical and polar circles Oscillation( edit)

 Short term( edit) Obliquity of the ecliptic for20,000 years, from Laskar(1986). The red point represents the year2000. The exact angular value of the obliquity is found by observation of the motions of Earth and planets over many years. Astronomers produce new fundamental ephemerides as the accuracy of observation improves and as the understanding of the dynamics increases, and from these ephemerides various astronomical values, including the obliquity, are derived.

 Annual almanacs are published listing the derived values and methods of use. Until1983, the Astronomical Almanac's angular value of the mean obliquity for any date was calculated based on the work of Newcomb, who analyzed positions of the planets until about1895:

ε=23°27′8.26''−46.845'' T−0.0059'' T+6997181000000000000♠0.00181'' T whereε is the obliquity and T is tropical centuries from B1900.0 to the date in question.

 From1984, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's DE series of computer- generated ephemerides took over as the fundamental ephemeris of the Astronomical Almanac. Obliquity based on DE200, which analyzed observations from1911 to1979, was calculated:

ε=23°26′21.45''−46.815'' T−0.0006'' T+6997181000000000000♠0.00181'' T where hereafter T is Julian centuries from J2000.0.

 JPL's fundamental ephemerides have been continually updated. For instance, the Astronomical Almanac for2010 specifies:

ε=23°26′21.406''−7001468367689999999♠46.836769'' T−6996183100000000000♠0.0001831'' T+6997200339999999999♠0.00200340'' T−5.76''×10 T−4.34''×10 T These expressions for the obliquity are intended for high precision over a relatively short time span, perhaps± several centuries. J. Laskar computed an expression to order T good to0.02'' over1000 years and several arcseconds over10,000 years.

ε=23°26′21.448''−4680.93'' t−1.55'' t+1999.25'' t−51.38'' t−249.67'' t−39.05'' t+7.12'' t+27.87'' t+5.79'' t+2.45'' t where here t is multiples of10,000 Julian years from J2000.0.

 These expressions are for the so- called mean obliquity, that is, the obliquity free from short- term variations. Periodic motions of the Moon and of Earth in its orbit cause much smaller(9.2 arcseconds) short- period( about18.6 years) oscillations of the rotation axis of Earth, known as nutation, which add a periodic component to Earth's obliquity. The true or instantaneous obliquity includes this nutation.

 Long term( edit) Main article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System Using numerical methods to simulate Solar System behavior, long- term changes in Earth's orbit, and hence its obliquity, have been investigated over a period of several million years. For the past5 million years, Earth's obliquity has varied between22°2′33'' and24°30′16'', with a mean period of41,040 years. This cycle is a combination of precession and the largest term in the motion of the ecliptic. For the next1 million years, the cycle will carry the obliquity between22°13′44'' and24°20′50''.

 The Moon has a stabilizing effect on Earth's obliquity. Frequency map analysis conducted in1993 suggested that, in the absence of the Moon, the obliquity can change rapidly due to orbital resonances and chaotic behavior of the Solar System, reaching as high as90° in as little as a few million years( also see Orbit of the Moon). However, more recent numerical simulations made in2011 indicated that even in the absence of the Moon, Earth's obliquity might not be quite so unstable; varying only by about20--25°. To resolve this contradiction, diffusion rate of obliquity has been calculated, and it was found that it takes more than billions of years for Earth's obliquity to reach near90°. The Moon's stabilizing effect will continue for less than2 billion years. As the Moon continues to recede from Earth due to tidal acceleration, resonances may occur which will cause large oscillations of the obliquity.

 Long- term obliquity of the ecliptic. Left: for the past5 million years; note that the obliquity varies only from about22.0° to24.5°. Right: for the next1 million years; note the approx.41,000- year period of variation. In both graphs, the red point represents the year1850.( Source: Berger,1976). Solar System bodies( edit)

 All four of the innermost, rocky planets of the Solar System may have had large variations of their obliquity in the past. Since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane, it changes as the orbital plane changes due to the influence of other planets. But the axis of rotation can also move( axial precession), due to torque exerted by the sun on a planet's equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession. If the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes. The rate varies due to tidal dissipation and core- mantle interaction, among other things. When a planet's precession rate approaches certain values, orbital resonances may cause large changes in obliquity. The amplitude of the contribution having one of the resonant rates is divided by the difference between the resonant rate and the precession rate, so it becomes large when the two are similar. Mercury and Venus have most likely been stabilized by the tidal dissipation of the Sun. Earth was stabilized by the Moon, as mentioned above, but before its capture, Earth, too, could have passed through times of instability. Mars's obliquity is quite variable over millions of years and may be in a chaotic state; it varies as much as0° to60° over some millions of years, depending on perturbations of the planets. Some authors dispute that Mars's obliquity is chaotic, and show that tidal dissipation and viscous core- mantle coupling are adequate for it to have reached a fully damped state, similar to Mercury and Venus. The occasional shifts in the axial tilt of Mars have been suggested as an explanation for the appearance and disappearance of rivers and lakes over the course of the existence of Mars. A shift could cause a burst of methane into the atmosphere, causing warming, but then the methane would be destroyed and the climate would become arid again.

 The obliquities of the outer planets are considered relatively stable.

Extrasolar planets( edit)

 Further information: Exoplanet§ Rotation and axial tilt The stellar obliquityψ, i.e. the axial tilt of a star with respect to the orbital plane of one of its planets, has been determined for only a few systems. But for49 stars as of today, the sky- projected spin- orbit misalignmentλ has been observed, which serves as a lower limit toψ. Most of these measurements rely on the Rossiter-- McLaughlin effect. So far, it has not been possible to constrain the obliquity of an extrasolar planet. But the rotational flattening of the planet and the entourage of moons and/ or rings, which are traceable with high- precision photometry, e.g. by the space- based Kepler spacecraft, could provide access toψ in the near future.

 Astrophysicists have applied tidal theories to predict the obliquity of extrasolar planets. It has been shown that the obliquities of exoplanets in the habitable zone around low- mass stars tend to be eroded in less than10 years, which means that they would not have seasons as Earth has.

 Jump to: navigation, search For the thermonuclear reaction involving carbon that powers some stars, see CNO cycle. For organic chemical ring- shaped structures, see Cyclic compounds. Movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and ocean in billions of tons per year. Yellow numbers are natural fluxes, red are human contributions, white are stored carbon. The effects of volcanic and tectonic activity are not included. The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth. Carbon is the main component of biological compounds as well as a major component of many minerals such as limestone. Along with the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle, the carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to make Earth capable of sustaining life. It describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere, as well as long- term processes of carbon sequestration to and release from carbon sinks.

 The carbon cycle was initially discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, and popularized by Humphry Davy.

 The atmosphere The terrestrial biosphere The ocean, including dissolved inorganic carbon and living and non-living marine biota The sediments, including fossil fuels, fresh water systems and non-living organic material. The Earth's interior( mantle and crust. These carbon stores interact with the other components through geological processes. The carbon exchanges between reservoirs occur as the result of various chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes. The ocean contains the largest active pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth. The natural flows of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial ecosystems, and sediments is fairly balanced, so that carbon levels would be roughly stable without human influence.

 Atmosphere( edit)

 Main article: Atmospheric carbon cycle Epiphytes on electric wires. This kind of plant takes both CO and water from the atmosphere for living and growing. Carbon in the Earth's atmosphere exists in two main forms: carbon dioxide and methane. Both of these gases absorb and retain heat in the atmosphere and are partially responsible for the greenhouse effect. Methane produces a larger greenhouse effect per volume as compared to carbon dioxide, but it exists in much lower concentrations and is more short- lived than carbon dioxide, making carbon dioxide the more important greenhouse gas of the two.

 Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere primarily through photosynthesis and enters the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres. Carbon dioxide also dissolves directly from the atmosphere into bodies of water( ocean, lakes, etc.), as well as dissolving in precipitation as raindrops fall through the atmosphere. When dissolved in water, carbon dioxide reacts with water molecules and forms carbonic acid, which contributes to ocean acidity. It can then be absorbed by rocks through weathering. It also can acidify other surfaces it touches or be washed into the ocean.

 Human activities over the past two centuries have significantly increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, mainly in the form of carbon dioxide, both by modifying ecosystems' ability to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and by emitting it directly, e.g., by burning fossil fuels and manufacturing concrete.

 Terrestrial biosphere( edit)

 Main article: Terrestrial biological carbon cycle A portable soil respiration system measuring soil CO flux The terrestrial biosphere includes the organic carbon in all land- living organisms, both alive and dead, as well as carbon stored in soils. About500 gigatons of carbon are stored above ground in plants and other living organisms, while soil holds approximately1,500 gigatons of carbon. Most carbon in the terrestrial biosphere is organic carbon, while about a third of soil carbon is stored in inorganic forms, such as calcium carbonate. Organic carbon is a major component of all organisms living on earth. Autotrophs extract it from the air in the form of carbon dioxide, converting it into organic carbon, while heterotrophs receive carbon by consuming other organisms.

 Because carbon uptake in the terrestrial biosphere is dependent on biotic factors, it follows a diurnal and seasonal cycle. In CO measurements, this feature is apparent in the Keeling curve. It is strongest in the northern hemisphere, because this hemisphere has more land mass than the southern hemisphere and thus more room for ecosystems to absorb and emit carbon.

 Carbon leaves the terrestrial biosphere in several ways and on different time scales. The combustion or respiration of organic carbon releases it rapidly into the atmosphere. It can also be exported into the ocean through rivers or remain sequestered in soils in the form of inert carbon. Carbon stored in soil can remain there for up to thousands of years before being washed into rivers by erosion or released into the atmosphere through soil respiration. Between1989 and2008 soil respiration increased by about0.1% per year. In2008, the global total of CO released from the soil reached roughly98 billion tonnes, about10 times more carbon than humans are now putting into the atmosphere each year by burning fossil fuel. There are a few plausible explanations for this trend, but the most likely explanation is that increasing temperatures have increased rates of decomposition of soil organic matter, which has increased the flow of CO. The length of carbon sequestering in soil is dependent on local climatic conditions and thus changes in the course of climate change. From pre-industrial era to2010, the terrestrial biosphere represented a net source of atmospheric CO prior to1940, switching subsequently to a net sink.

 Ocean( edit)

 Main article: Oceanic carbon cycle The ocean contains the greatest quantity of actively cycled carbon in this world and are second only to the lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store. Its surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved inorganic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon( DIC) is about15% higher than that of the surface layer. DIC is stored in the deep layer for much longer periods of time. Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.

 Carbon enters the ocean mainly through the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is converted into carbonate. It can also enter the ocean through rivers as dissolved organic carbon. It is converted by organisms into organic carbon through photosynthesis and can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the ocean's deeper, more carbon rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells as calcium carbonate. It circulates in this layer for long periods of time before either being deposited as sediment or, eventually, returned to the surface waters through thermohaline circulation.

 Oceanic absorption of CO is one of the most important forms of carbon sequestering limiting the human- caused rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, this process is limited by a number of factors. Because the rate of CO dissolution in the ocean is dependent on the weathering of rocks and this process takes place slower than current rates of human greenhouse gas emissions, ocean CO uptake will decrease in the future. CO absorption also makes water more acidic, which affects ocean biosystems. The projected rate of increasing oceanic acidity could slow the biological precipitation of calcium carbonates, thus decreasing the ocean's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide.

 Earth's interior( edit)

 The geologic component of the carbon cycle operates slowly in comparison to the other parts of the global carbon cycle. It is one of the most important determinants of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus of global temperatures.

 Most of the earth's carbon is stored inertly in the earth's lithosphere. Much of the carbon stored in the earth's mantle was stored there when the earth formed. Some of it was deposited in the form of organic carbon from the biosphere. Of the carbon stored in the geosphere, about80% is limestone and its derivatives, which form from the sedimentation of calcium carbonate stored in the shells of marine organisms. The remaining20% is stored as kerogens formed through the sedimentation and burial of terrestrial organisms under high heat and pressure. Organic carbon stored in the geosphere can remain there for millions of years.

 Carbon can leave the geosphere in several ways. Carbon dioxide is released during the metamorphosis of carbonate rocks when they are subducted into the earth's mantle. This carbon dioxide can be released into the atmosphere and ocean through volcanoes and hotspots. It can also be removed by humans through the direct extraction of kerogens in the form of fossil fuels. After extraction, fossil fuels are burned to release energy, thus emitting the carbon they store into the atmosphere.

 Human influence( edit)

 Main article: Global warming Human activity since the industrial era has changed the balance in the natural carbon cycle. Units are in gigatons. CO in Earth's atmosphere if half of global- warming emissions are not absorbed.( NASA computer simulation). Since the industrial revolution, human activity has modified the carbon cycle by changing its components' functions and directly adding carbon to the atmosphere.

 The largest human impact on the carbon cycle is through direct emissions from burning fossil fuels, which transfers carbon from the geosphere into the atmosphere. The rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land- use, particularly deforestation.

 Another direct human impact on the carbon cycle is the chemical process of calcination of limestone for clinker production, which releases CO. Clinker is an industrial precursor of cement.

 Humans also influence the carbon cycle indirectly by changing the terrestrial and oceanic biosphere. Over the past several centuries, direct and indirect human- caused land use and land cover change( LUCC) has led to the loss of biodiversity, which lowers ecosystems' resilience to environmental stresses and decreases their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. More directly, it often leads to the release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere. Deforestation for agricultural purposes removes forests, which hold large amounts of carbon, and replaces them, generally with agricultural or urban areas. Both of these replacement land cover types store comparatively small amounts of carbon, so that the net product of the process is that more carbon stays in the atmosphere.

 Other human- caused changes to the environment change ecosystems' productivity and their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Air pollution, for example, damages plants and soils, while many agricultural and land use practices lead to higher erosion rates, washing carbon out of soils and decreasing plant productivity.

 Humans also affect the oceanic carbon cycle. Current trends in climate change lead to higher ocean temperatures, thus modifying ecosystems. Also, acid rain and polluted runoff from agriculture and industry change the ocean's chemical composition. Such changes can have dramatic effects on highly sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs, thus limiting the ocean's ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere on a regional scale and reducing oceanic biodiversity globally.

 Arctic methane emissions indirectly caused by anthropogenic global warming also affect the carbon cycle, and contribute to further warming in what is known as climate change feedback.

 On12 November2015, NASA scientists reported that human- made carbon dioxide( CO) continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years: currently, about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels remains in the atmosphere and is not absorbed by vegetation and the ocean.

 Jump to: navigation, search Carbon dioxide in Earth's troposphere2011 carbon dioxide mole fraction in the troposphere Play media This visualization shows global carbon dioxide concentrations( colored squares) in parts per million by volume( ppmv). Play media A model of the behavior of carbon in the atmosphere from September1,2014 to August31,2015. The height of Earth's atmosphere and topography have been vertically exaggerated and appear approximately40 times higher than normal to show the complexity of the atmospheric flow. Carbon dioxide( CO) is an important trace gas in Earth's atmosphere. CO is a major greenhouse gas and plays a vital role in regulating Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide is an integral part of the carbon cycle, a biogeochemical cycle in which carbon is exchanged between the Earth's oceans, soil, rocks and the biosphere. Plants and other photoautotrophs use solar energy to produce carbohydrate from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water by photosynthesis. Almost all other organisms depend on carbohydrate derived from photosynthesis as their primary source of energy and carbon compounds.

 Reconstructions show that concentrations of CO in the atmosphere have varied from as high as7,000 parts per million( ppm) during the Cambrian period about500 million years ago to as low as180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years. Global annual mean CO concentration has increased by more than45% since the start of the Industrial Revolution. The concentration was280 ppm during the10,000 years up to the mid-18th century, increasing to407 ppm as of mid-2017. The present concentration is the highest in at least the past800,000 years and likely the highest in the past20 million years. The increase has been caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. This increase of CO and other greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere has produced the current episode of global warming. About30--40% of the CO released by humans into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans, rivers and lakes, which has produced ocean acidification.

 Current concentration( edit)

 See also: Global warming, Climate change, Atmospheric methane, Holocene climate, and Quaternary climate CO concentrations over the last400,000 years Over the past400,000 years, CO concentrations have shown several cycles of variation from about180 parts per million during the deep glaciations of the Holocene and Pleistocene to280 parts per million during the interglacial periods. Each part per million by volume of CO in the atmosphere contains approximately2.13 gigatonnes of carbon. Currently CO constitutes about0.041%( equal to410 ppm) by volume of the atmosphere, which corresponds to approximately3200 gigatons of CO, which includes approximately870 gigatons of carbon. The global mean CO concentration is currently rising at a rate of approximately2 ppm/ year and accelerating.

 Following the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO concentration has increased to over400 parts per million and continues to increase. The daily average concentration of atmospheric CO at Mauna Loa Observatory first exceeded400 ppm on10 May2013. This has caused the phenomenon of global warming. The global average concentration of CO in Earth's atmosphere is currently about0.04%, or400 parts per million by volume( ppm). There is an annual fluctuation of about3--9 ppm which is negatively correlated with the Northern Hemisphere's growing season. The Northern Hemisphere dominates the annual cycle of CO concentration because it has much greater land area and plant biomass than the Southern Hemisphere. Concentrations reach a peak in May as the Northern Hemisphere spring greenup begins, and decline to a minimum in October, near the end of the growing season.

 Since global warming is attributed to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO, scientists closely monitor atmospheric CO concentrations and their impact on the present- day biosphere. At the scientific recording station in Mauna Loa, the concentration reached400 ppm for the first time in May2013, although this concentration had already been reached in the Arctic in June2012. The National Geographic wrote that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is this high`` for the first time in55 years of measurement-- and probably more than3 million years of Earth history.'' The current concentration may be the highest in the last20 million years.

 Past concentration( edit)

 See also: Paleoclimatology and Great Oxygenation Event Changes in carbon dioxide during the Phanerozoic( the last542 million years). The recent period is located on the left side of the plot. This figure illustrates a range of events over the last550 million years during which CO played a role in global climate. The graph begins( on the right) with an era predating terrestrial plant life, during which solar output was more than4% lower than today. Land plants only became widespread after400Ma, during the Devonian( D) period, and their diversification( along with the evolution of leaves) may have been partially driven by a decrease in CO concentration. Toward the left side of the graph the sun gradually approaches modern levels of solar output, while vegetation spreads, removing large amounts of CO from the atmosphere. The last200 million years includes periods of extreme warmth, and sea levels so high that200 metre- deep shallow seas formed on continental land masses( for example, at100Ma during the Cretaceous( K) Greenhouse). At the far left of the graph, we see modern CO levels and the appearance of the climate under which human species and human civilization developed.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.( July2016)( Learn how and when to remove this template message) Carbon dioxide concentrations have varied widely over the Earth's4.54 billion year history. Carbon dioxide is believed to have been present in Earth's first atmosphere, shortly after Earth's formation. Earth's second atmosphere emerged after the lighter gases, hydrogen and helium, escaped to space or like oxygen were bound up in molecules and is thought to have consisted largely of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and inert gases produced by outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by asteroids. The production of free oxygen by cyanobacterial photosynthesis eventually led to the oxygen catastrophe that ended Earth's second atmosphere and brought about the Earth's third atmosphere( the modern atmosphere)2.4 billion years before the present. Carbon dioxide concentrations dropped from7,000 parts per million during the Cambrian period about500 million years ago to as low as180 parts per million during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.

 Drivers of ancient- Earth carbon dioxide concentration( edit)

 On long timescales, atmospheric CO concentration is determined by the balance among geochemical processes including organic carbon burial in sediments, silicate rock weathering, and volcanism. The net effect of slight imbalances in the carbon cycle over tens to hundreds of millions of years has been to reduce atmospheric CO. On a timescale of billions of years, such downward trend appears bound to continue indefinitely as occasional massive historical releases of buried carbon due to volcanism will become less frequent( as earth mantle cooling and progressive exhaustion of internal radioactive heat proceeds further). The rates of these processes are extremely slow; hence they are of no relevance to the atmospheric CO concentration over the next hundreds or thousands of years.

 In billion- year timescales, it is predicted that plant, and therefore animal, life on land will die off altogether, since by that time most of the remaining carbon in the atmosphere will be sequestered underground, and natural releases of CO by radioactivity- driven tectonic activity will have continued to slow down. The loss of plant life would also result in the eventual loss of oxygen. Some microbes are capable of photosynthesis at concentrations of CO of a few parts per million and so the last life forms would probably disappear finally due to the rising temperatures and loss of the atmosphere when the sun becomes a red giant some four billion years from now.

 Measuring ancient- Earth carbon dioxide concentration( edit)

 See also: climate reconstruction proxies Graph of CO( green), reconstructed temperature( blue) and dust( red) from the Vostok ice core for the past420,000 years The most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations for periods before instrumental sampling is to measure bubbles of air( fluid or gas inclusions) trapped in the Antarctic or Greenland ice sheets. The most widely accepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate that atmospheric CO concentrations were about260--280 ppmv immediately before industrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the preceding10,000 years. The longest ice core record comes from East Antarctica, where ice has been sampled to an age of800,000 years. During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has varied between180--210 ppm during ice ages, increasing to280--300 ppm during warmer interglacials. The beginning of human agriculture during the current Holocene epoch may have been strongly connected to the atmospheric CO increase after the last ice age ended, a fertilization effect raising plant biomass growth and reducing stomatal conductance requirements for CO intake, consequently reducing transpiration water losses and increasing water usage efficiency.

 Various proxy measurements have been used to attempt to determine atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations millions of years in the past. These include boron and carbon isotope ratios in certain types of marine sediments, and the number of stomata observed on fossil plant leaves. While these measurements give much less precise estimates of carbon dioxide concentration than ice cores, there is evidence for very high CO volume concentrations between200 and150 million years ago of over3,000 ppm, and between600 and400 million years ago of over6,000 ppm. In more recent times, atmospheric CO concentration continued to fall after about60 million years ago. About34 million years ago, the time of the Eocene-- Oligocene extinction event and when the Antarctic ice sheet started to take its current form, CO is found to have been about760 ppm, and there is geochemical evidence that concentrations were less than300 ppm by about20 million years ago. Carbon dioxide decrease, with a tipping point of600 ppm, was the primary agent forcing Antarctic glaciation. Low CO concentrations may have been the stimulus that favored the evolution of C4 plants, which increased greatly in abundance between7 and5 million years ago.

 Ancient- Earth climate reconstruction is a vibrant field with numerous studies and reconstructions that sometimes reinforce one another and sometimes disagree with each other. Academically, one study disputed the claim of stable CO concentrations during the present interglacial of the last10,000 years. Based on an analysis of fossil leaves, Wagner et al. argued that CO levels during the last7,000--10,000 year period were significantly higher(~300 ppm) and contained substantial variations that may be correlated to climate variations. Others have disputed such claims, suggesting they are more likely to reflect calibration problems than actual changes in CO. Relevant to this dispute is the observation that Greenland ice cores often report higher and more variable CO values than similar measurements in Antarctica. However, the groups responsible for such measurements( e.g. H. J Smith et al.) believe the variations in Greenland cores result from in situ decomposition of calcium carbonate dust found in the ice. When dust concentrations in Greenland cores are low, as they nearly always are in Antarctic cores, the researchers report good agreement between measurements of Antarctic and Greenland CO concentrations.

 Atmospheric carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect( edit)

 Main articles: greenhouse effect and radiative forcing See also: Faint young Sun paradox and global warming A pictogram of the greenhouse effect Earth's natural greenhouse effect makes life as we know it possible and carbon dioxide plays a significant role in providing for the relatively warm temperature that the planet enjoys. The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's temperature would be about−18° C(-0.4° F) compared to Earth's actual surface temperature of approximately14° C(57.2° F).

 Carbon dioxide is believed to have played an important effect in regulating Earth's temperature throughout its4.7 billion year history. Early in the Earth's life, scientists have found evidence of liquid water indicating a warm world even though the Sun's output is believed to have only been70% of what it is today. It has been suggested by scientists that higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Earth atmosphere might help explain this faint young sun paradox. When Earth first formed, Earth's atmosphere may have contained more greenhouse gases and CO concentrations may have been higher, with estimated partial pressure as large as1,000 kPa(10 bar), because there was no bacterial photosynthesis to reduce the gas to carbon compounds and oxygen. Methane, a very active greenhouse gas which reacts with oxygen to produce CO and water vapor, may have been more prevalent as well, with a mixing ratio of10(100 parts per million by volume).

 Contribution of natural factors and human activities to radiative forcing( RF) of climate change. RF values are for year2005, relative to pre-industrial(1750). The contribution of solar irradiance to RF is5% the value of the combined RF due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Though water is responsible for most( about36-70%) of the total greenhouse effect, the role of water vapor as a greenhouse gas depends on temperature. On earth, carbon dioxide is the most relevant direct anthropologically influenced greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is often mentioned in the context of its increased influence as a greenhouse gas since the pre-industrial(1750) era. In the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report the increase in CO was estimated to be responsible for1.82 W m of the2.63 W m change in radiative forcing on earth( about70%).

 The concept of atmospheric CO increasing ground temperature was first published by Svante Arrhenius in1896. The increased radiative forcing due to increased CO in the earth's atmosphere is based on the physical properties of CO and the non-saturated absorption windows where CO absorbs outgoing long- wave energy.

 Atmospheric carbon dioxide and the carbon cycle( edit)

 Main articles: Carbon cycle and Atmospheric carbon cycle This diagram of the fast carbon cycle shows the movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and oceans in billions of tons of carbon per year. Yellow numbers are natural fluxes, red are human contributions in billions of tons of carbon per year. White numbers indicate stored carbon. Atmospheric carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the Earth's carbon cycle whereby carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by some natural processes such as photosynthesis and deposition of carbonates, to form limestones for example, and added back to the atmosphere by other natural processes such as respiration and the acid dissolution of carbonate deposits. There are two broad carbon cycles on earth: the fast carbon cycle and the slow carbon cycle. The fast carbon cycle refers to movements of carbon between the environment and living things in the biosphere whereas the slow carbon cycle involves the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, soil, rocks and volcanism. Both carbon cycles are intrinsically interconnected and atmospheric gaseous carbon dioxide facilitates the carbon cycle.

 Natural sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide include volcanic outgassing, the combustion of organic matter, wildfires and the respiration processes of living aerobic organisms. Man- made sources of carbon dioxide include the burning of fossil fuels for heating, power generation and transport, as well as some industrial processes such as cement making. It is also produced by various microorganisms from fermentation and cellular respiration. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria convert carbon dioxide to carbohydrates by a process called photosynthesis. They gain the energy needed for this reaction from absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll and other pigments. Oxygen, produced as a by- product of photosynthesis, is released into the atmosphere and subsequently used for respiration by heterotrophic organisms and other plants, forming a cycle.

 Most sources of CO emissions are natural, and are balanced to various degrees by natural CO sinks. For example, the natural decay of organic material in forests and grasslands and the action of forest fires results in the release of about439 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide every year, while new growth entirely counteracts this effect, absorbing450 gigatonnes per year. Although the initial carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the young Earth was produced by volcanic activity, modern volcanic activity releases only130 to230 megatonnes of carbon dioxide each year. These natural sources are nearly balanced by natural sinks, physical and biological processes which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. For example, some is directly removed from the atmosphere by land plants for photosynthesis and it is soluble in water forming carbonic acid. There is a large natural flux of CO into and out of the biosphere and oceans. In the pre-industrial era these fluxes were largely in balance. Currently about57% of human- emitted CO is removed by the biosphere and oceans. From pre-industrial era to2010, the terrestrial biosphere represented a net source of atmospheric CO prior to1940, switching subsequently to a net sink. The ratio of the increase in atmospheric CO to emitted CO is known as the airborne fraction( Keeling et al.,1995); this varies for short- term averages and is typically about45% over longer(5 year) periods. Estimated carbon in global terrestrial vegetation increased from approximately740 billion tons in1910 to780 billion tons in1990.

Orange labels: known ice ages. Also see: Human timeline and Nature timeline Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is essential to life and to the present planetary biosphere. Over the course of Earth's geologic history CO concentrations have played a role in biological evolution. The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide as sources of electrons, rather than water. Cyanobacteria appeared later, and the excess oxygen they produced contributed to the oxygen catastrophe, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. In recent geologic times, low CO concentrations below600 parts per million might have been the stimulus that favored the evolution of C4 plants which increased greatly in abundance between7 and5 million years ago over plants that use the less efficient C3 metabolic pathway. At current atmospheric pressures photosynthesis shuts down when atmospheric CO concentrations fall below150 ppm and200 ppm although some microbes can extract carbon from the air at much lower concentrations. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately130 terawatts, which is about six times larger than the current power consumption of human civilization. Photosynthetic organisms also convert around100--115 thousand million metric tonnes of carbon into biomass per year.

 Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O, and fixes CO into sugar. Photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from CO and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms that use light as a source of energy carry out photosynthesis, since photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than CO, as a source of carbon. In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This is called oxygenic photosynthesis. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. However, there are some types of bacteria that carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis, which consumes CO but does not release oxygen.

 Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction, so photosynthesis needs to supply both a source of energy to drive this process, and the electrons needed to convert CO into a carbohydrate. This addition of the electrons is a reduction reaction. In general outline and in effect, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration, in which glucose and other compounds are oxidized to produce CO and water, and to release exothermic chemical energy to drive the organism's metabolism. However, the two processes take place through a different sequence of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments.

 Most organisms that utilize photosynthesis to produce oxygen use visible light to do so, although at least three use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, far- red radiation.

 Impact on plant growth( edit)

 A1993 review of scientific greenhouse studies found that a doubling of CO concentration would stimulate the growth of156 different plant species by an average of37%. The amount of gain varied significantly by species, with some showing much greater gains, and a small number showing a loss. For example, a1979 greenhouse study compared the dry weights of cotton and maize plants grown in different greenhouses, one with double the CO concentration of the other. In the enriched CO air, the dry weight of40- day- old cotton plants doubled, but the dry weight of30- day- old maize plants increased by only20%.

 Because of concerns that greenhouse experiments might not adequately simulate the actual environment( such as competing plants), scientists developed Free- air carbon dioxide enrichment( FACE) experiments. In this procedure, plants are grown outdoors, and the CO concentration of the surrounding air is artificially elevated. FACE experiments, using generally lower CO levels than the greenhouse studies, showed lower gains in growth than greenhouse studies, with the gains depending heavily on the species under study. A2005 review of12 experiments at475-600 ppm showed an average gain of17% in crop yield, with legumes typically showing a greater response than other species, and C4 plants generally showing less. The review also stated that the reviewed experiments have their own limitations. The studied CO levels were lower, and most of the experiments were carried out in temperate regions.

 Atmospheric carbon dioxide and the Oceanic carbon cycle( edit)

 Main article: Oceanic carbon cycle See also: Solubility pump and Ocean acidification Air- sea exchange of CO The Earth's oceans contain a large amount of CO in the form of bicarbonate and carbonate ions-- much more than the amount in the atmosphere. The bicarbonate is produced in reactions between rock, water, and carbon dioxide. One example is the dissolution of calcium carbonate:

 CaCO3+ CO+ H2O⇌ Ca2++2 HCO− Reactions like this tend to buffer changes in atmospheric CO. Since the right side of the reaction produces an acidic compound, adding CO on the left side decreases the pH of sea water, a process which has been termed ocean acidification( pH of the ocean becomes more acidic although the pH value remains in the alkaline range). Reactions between CO and non-carbonate rocks also add bicarbonate to the seas. This can later undergo the reverse of the above reaction to form carbonate rocks, releasing half of the bicarbonate as CO. Over hundreds of millions of years, this has produced huge quantities of carbonate rocks.

 Ultimately, most of the CO emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean; however, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain. Even if equilibrium is reached, including dissolution of carbonate minerals, the increased concentration of bicarbonate and decreased or unchanged concentration of carbonate ion will give rise to a higher concentration of un-ionized carbonic acid and dissolved CO. This, along with higher temperatures, would mean a higher equilibrium concentration of CO in the air.

 Anthropogenic CO emissions( edit)

 See also: radiative forcing, List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions, and Global warming While CO absorption and release is always happening as a result of natural processes, the recent rise in CO levels in the atmosphere is known to be mainly due to human( anthropogenic) activity. There are4 ways human activity, especially fossil fuel burning, is known to have caused the rapid increase in atmospheric CO over the last few centuries.1) Various national statistics accounting for fossil fuel consumption, combined with knowledge of how much atmospheric CO is produced per unit of fossil fuel( e.g. liter of gasoline).2) By examining the ratio of various carbon isotopes in the atmosphere. The burning of long- buried fossil fuels releases CO containing carbon of different isotopic ratios to those of living plants, enabling distinction between natural and human- caused contributions to CO concentration.3) Higher atmospheric CO concentrations in the northern hemisphere, where most of the world's population lives( and emissions originate from), compared to the southern hemisphere. This difference has increased as anthropogenic emissions have increased.4) Atmospheric O levels are decreasing in earth's atmosphere as it reacts with the carbon in fossil fuels to form CO.

 Burning fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas is the leading cause of increased anthropogenic CO; deforestation is the second major cause. In2010,9.14 gigatonnes of carbon( GtC, equivalent to33.5 gigatonnes of CO or about4.3 ppm in earth's atmosphere) were released from fossil fuels and cement production worldwide, compared to6.15 GtC in1990. In addition, land use change contributed0.87 GtC in2010, compared to1.45 GtC in1990. In1997, human- caused Indonesian peat fires were estimated to have released between13% and40% of the average carbon emissions caused by the burning of fossil fuels around the world in a single year. In the period1751 to1900, about12 GtC were released as CO to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels, whereas from1901 to2013 the figure was about380 GtC.

 CO in Earth's atmosphere if half of anthropogenic CO emissions are not absorbed.( NASA computer simulation). Anthropogenic carbon emissions exceed the amount that can be taken up or balanced out by natural sinks. As a result, carbon dioxide has gradually accumulated in the atmosphere, and as of2013, its concentration is almost43% above pre-industrial levels. Various techniques have been proposed for removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in carbon dioxide sinks. Currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the atmosphere.

 Excess CO emitted since the pre-industrial era is projected to remain in the atmosphere for centuries to millennia, even after emissions stop. Even if human carbon dioxide emissions were to completely cease, atmospheric temperatures are not expected to decrease significantly for thousands of years.

 Ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO( edit)

 See also: TCCON and Space- based measurements of carbon dioxide Carbon Dioxide observations from2005 to2014 showing the seasonal variations and the difference between northern and southern hemispheres The first reproducibly accurate measurements of atmospheric CO were from flask sample measurements made by Dave Keeling at Caltech in the1950s. A few years later in March1958 the first ongoing measurements were started by Keeling at Mauna Loa. Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since then. Now measurements are made at many sites globally. Additional measurement techniques are also used as well. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks. Global network data are often made publicly available on the conditions of proper acknowledgement according to the respective data user policies.

 There are several surface measurement( including flasks and continuous in situ) networks including NOAA/ ERSL, WDCGG, and RAMCES. The NOAA/ ESRL Baseline Observatory Network, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Network data are hosted at the CDIAC at ORNL. The World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases( WDCGG), part of GAW, data are hosted by the JMA. The Reseau Atmospherique de Mesure des Composes an Effet de Serre database( RAMCES) is part of IPSL.

 From these measurements, further products are made which integrate data from the various sources. These products also address issues such as data discontinuity and sparseness. GLOBALVIEW- CO2 is one of these products.

 Ongoing ground- based total column measurements began more recently. Column measurements typically refer to an averaged column amount denoted X, rather than a surface only measurement. These measurements are made by the TCCON. These data are also hosted on the CDIAC, and made publicly available according to the data use policy.

 Satellite measurements are also a recent addition to atmospheric X measurements. SCIAMACHY aboard ESA's ENVISAT made global column X measurements from2002-2012. AIRS aboard NASA's Aqua satellite makes global X measurements and was launched shortly after ENVISAT in2012. More recent satellites have significantly improved the data density and precision of global measurements. Newer missions have higher spectral and spatial resolutions. JAXA's GOSAT was the first dedicated GHG monitoring satellite to successfully achieve orbit in2009. NASA's OCO-2 launched in2014 was the second. Various other satellites missions to measure atmospheric X are planned.

 Jump to: navigation, search For other uses, see Continent( disambiguation). Animated, colour- coded map showing the various continents and regions. Depending on the convention and model, some continents may be consolidated or subdivided: for example, Eurasia is most often subdivided into Asia and Europe( red shades), while North and South America are sometimes recognised as one American continent( green shades). A continent is one of several very large landmasses of the world. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.

 Geologically the continents largely correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental plates. However, some areas of continental crust are regions covered with water not usually included in the list of continents. The area referred to as Zealandia is one such area( see submerged continents below).

 Islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into geopolitical regions. Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a geopolitical region called Oceania.

 Definitions and application

 A Dymaxion map shows land masses with minimal shape distortion. By convention,`` continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water.'' Several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water. The criterion`` large'' leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a surface area of2,166,086 square kilometres(836,330 sq mi) is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at7,617,930 square kilometres(2,941,300 sq mi) is deemed the smallest continent.

 Earth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which is divided into a number of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.

 Extent

 The most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe( sometimes referred to in Britain as`` the Continent'') is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands such as Great Britain, Ireland, Malta and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the mainland of Australia, excluding Tasmania and New Guinea. Similarly, the continental United States refers to the48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in central North America and may include Alaska in the northwest of the continent( the two being separated by Canada), while excluding Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam in the oceans.

 From the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area( the continental shelf) and the islands on the shelf( continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.

 From this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level. In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.

 Map of island countries: these states are often grouped geographically with a neighboring continental landmass. As a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and Madagascar part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the Australian continental plate with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called Oceania. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.

 Separation

 Main article: Boundaries between the continents of Earth See also: List of transcontinental countries The ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as`` more or less discrete masses of land''. Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water( disregarding the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk of the landmasses they unite.

 North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven- continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the Americas. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six- continent models. This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.

 The criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of10,180,000 square kilometres(3,930,000 sq mi), while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view-- in geology and geography-- that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six- continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism:`` In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country.(...).'' However, for historical and cultural reasons, the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.

 If continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro- Eurasia. This produces a four- continent model consisting of Afro- Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.

 When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges. At those times Australia-- New Guinea was a single, continuous continent. Likewise the Americas and Afro- Eurasia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro- Eurasia- America, Antarctica, and Australia- New Guinea.

 Number

 There are several ways of distinguishing the continents:

 Models Color- coded map showing the various continents. Similar shades exhibit areas that may be consolidated or subdivided. Four continents Afro- Eurasia America Antarctica Australia Five continents Africa Eurasia America Antarctica Australia Six continents Africa Asia Europe America Antarctica Australia Six continents Africa Eurasia North America South America Antarctica Australia/ Oceania Seven continents Africa Asia Europe North America South America Antarctica Australia/ Oceania The seven- continent model is usually taught in China, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, parts of Western Europe and most English- speaking countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom. The six- continent combined- Eurasia model is mostly used in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Japan. The six- continent combined- America model is often used in France and its former possessions, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, Latin America, and Greece. A five- continent model is obtained from this model by excluding Antarctica as uninhabited. This is used, for example in the United Nations and in the Olympic Charter in its description of the Olympic flag. The term Oceania refers to a group of island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean, together with the continent of Australia. Pacific islands with ties to other continents( such as Japan, Hawaii or Easter Island) are usually grouped with those continents rather than Oceania. This term is used in several different continental models instead of Australia.

 Other divisions

 Supercontinents

 Aside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term continent varies. Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core. These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, and Pangaea.

 Subcontinents

 Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula. The southern cone of South America and Alaskan peninsula of North America are other examples.

 In many of these cases, the`` subcontinents'' concerned are on different tectonic plates from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology. Greenland, generally reckoned as the world's largest island on the northeastern periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent. This is a significant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent.

 Where the Americas are viewed as a single continent( America), it is divided into two subcontinents( North America and South America) or three( with Central America being the third). When Eurasia is regarded as a single continent, Europe is treated as a subcontinent.

 Submerged continents

 Some areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents. Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the sea primarily in New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the almost completely submerged Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean.

 Microcontinents

 Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered microcontinents. Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as`` the eighth continent'' from a biological perspective.

 Botanical continents

`` Botanical continents'' defined by the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions.`` Continents'' may be defined differently for specific purposes. The Biodiversity Information Standards organization has developed the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions, used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine`` botanical continents''. Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America( Mexico northwards) and Southern America( Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.

 History of continental configurations

 Main article: Geological history of the Earth History of the concept

 The Ancient Greek geographer Strabo holding a globe showing Europa and Asia Early concepts of the old world continents

 The term`` continent'' translates Greekἤπειρος, properly`` landmass, terra firma'', the proper name of Epirus and later especially used of Asia( i.e. Asia Minor), The first distinction between continents was made by ancient Greek mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus strait and the Black Sea. The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands. But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and``... beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia...''

 Ancient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa( then called Libya) should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate. From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south. The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, the Europe-- Asia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the Rioni River( known then as the Phasis) in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River( known then as the Tanais) in Russia. The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River. Herodotus in the5th century BC, however, objected to the unity of Egypt being split into Asia and Africa(`` Libya'') and took the boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the division into three of what is really a single landmass, a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.

 Eratosthenes, in the3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers( the Nile and the Don), thus considering them`` islands''. Others divided the continents by isthmuses, calling the continents`` peninsulas''. These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the Red Sea and the mouth of Lake Bardawil on the Mediterranean Sea.

 Medieval T and O map showing the three continents as domains of the sons of Noah-- Asia to Sem( Shem), Europe to Iafeth( Japheth), and Africa to Cham( Ham). Through the Roman period and the Middle Ages, a few writers took the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt( Gibbon). In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on T and O maps, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the18th century,`` the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus( the boundary between Egypt and Libya) farther west, had even then scarcely passed away''.

 European arrival in the Americas

 Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the Americas. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continent-- he always thought it was part of Asia.

 In1501, Amerigo Vespucci and Gonçalo Coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean, passing through Fernando de Noronha. After reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America, confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to. On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called Mundus Novus(`` New World''), was published under Vespucci's name in1502 or1503, although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer. Regardless of who penned the words, Mundus Novus credited Vespucci with saying,`` I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa'', the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.

 Within a few years the name`` New World'' began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana( Pesaro) map of around1504--1505. Maps of this time though, still showed North America connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.

 Universalis Cosmographia, Waldseemüller's1507 world map-- the first to show the Americas separate from Asia In1507 Martin Waldseemüller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named`` America'' after Amerigo Vespucci's first name. On the map, the word`` America'' was placed on part of South America.

 The word continent

 From the16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning continuous or connected land and translated from the Latin terra continens. The noun was used to mean`` a connected or continuous tract of land'' or mainland. It was not applied only to very large areas of land-- in the17th century, references were made to the continents( or mainlands) of Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales and in1745 to Sumatra. The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three`` parts'' of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.

 While continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that`` A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa.'' In1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclopædia,`` The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the old and the new.'' And in his1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as`` a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another.'' However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as`` parts'' of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.

 From the late18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the19th century.

 Europeans discovered Australia in1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth( or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent). In1813, Samuel Butler wrote of Australia as`` New Holland, an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent'' and the Oxford English Dictionary was just as equivocal some decades later.

 Antarctica was sighted in1820 during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition and described as a continent by Charles Wilkes on the United States Exploring Expedition in1838, the last continent identified, although a great`` Antarctic''( antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after World War II.

 From the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.

 From the1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents. With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven- continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to Latin Americans, who saw their region spanning an América as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains dominant, as it does in scattered other countries.

 Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia. In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.

 Geology

 This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.( May2015)( Learn how and when to remove this template message) Further information: Continental crust and Plate tectonics Geologists use the term continent in a different manner from geographers. In geology a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some geologists restrict the term' continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian`` shield'', typically1.5 to3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts( mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break- up from plate tectonic activity. An outward- thickening veneer of younger, minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate- tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are`` high and dry''; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.

 The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans Some argue that continents are accretionary crustal`` rafts'' that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas( i.e. East European craton and Indian craton). Younger mobile belts( such as the Ural Mountains and Himalayas) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.

 There are many microcontinents, or continental fragments, that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent, whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continent-- only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.

 Plate tectonics offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified Eurasian Plate, which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent Himalaya mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland( a portion of the Canadian Shield), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian land mass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions(`` continental rocks,''`` plate boundaries'') are used as appropriate.

 The movement of plates has caused the formation and break- up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of2.0--1.8 billion years ago and broke up about1.5--1.3 billion years ago. The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around600 million years ago. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia( which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana( which became the remaining continents).

The lowest non-submarine bedrock elevations in these continents are the trough beneath Jakobshavn Glacier(−1,512 metres(−4,961 ft)) and Bentley Subglacial Trench(−2,540 metres(−8,330 ft)), but these are covered by kilometers of ice.

 Some sources list the Kuma-- Manych Depression( a remnant of the Paratethys) as the geological border between Europe and Asia. This would place the Caucasus outside of Europe, thus making Mont Blanc( elevation4810 m) in the Graian Alps the highest point in Europe- the lowest point would still be the shore of the Caspian Sea.

 Jump to: navigation, search For any other use, see Crust( disambiguation). The internal structure of Earth In geology, the crust is the outermost solid shell of a rocky planet, dwarf planet, or natural satellite. It is usually distinguished from the underlying mantle by its chemical makeup; however, in the case of icy satellites, it may be distinguished based on its phase( solid crust vs. liquid mantle).

 The crusts of Earth, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Io, and other planetary bodies formed via igneous processes, and were later modified by erosion, impact cratering, volcanism, and sedimentation.

 Most terrestrial planets have fairly uniform crusts. Earth, however, has two distinct types: continental crust and oceanic crust. These two types have different chemical compositions and physical properties, and were formed by different geological processes.

 Types of crust

 Planetary geologists divide crust into three categories, based on how and when they formed.

 Primary crust/ primordial crust

 This is a planet's`` original'' crust. It forms from solidification of a magma ocean. Toward the end of planetary accretion, the terrestrial planets likely had surfaces that were magma oceans. As these cooled, they solidified into crust. This crust was likely destroyed by large impacts and re-formed many times as the Era of Heavy Bombardment drew to a close.

 The nature of primary crust is still debated: its chemical, mineralogic, and physical properties are unknown, as are the igneous mechanisms that formed them. This is because it is difficult to study: none of Earth's primary crust has survived to today. Earth's high rates of erosion and crustal recycling from plate tectonics has destroyed all rocks older than about4 billion years, including whatever primary crust Earth once had.

 However, geologists can glean information about primary crust by studying it on other terrestrial planets. Mercury's highlands might represent primary crust, though this is debated. The anorthosite highlands of the Moon are primary crust, formed as plagioclase crystallized out of the Moon's initial magma ocean and floated to the top; however, it is unlikely that Earth followed a similar pattern, as the Moon was a water-less system and Earth had water. The Martian meteorite ALH84001 might represent primary crust of Mars; however, again, this is debated. Like Earth, Venus lacks primary crust, as the entire planet has been repeatedly resurfaced and modified.

 Secondary crust

 Secondary crust is formed by partial melting of silicate materials in the mantle, and so is usually basaltic in composition.

 This is the most common type of crust in the Solar System. Most of the surfaces of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars comprise secondary crust, as do the lunar maria. On Earth, we see secondary crust forming primarily at mid-ocean spreading centers, where the adiabatic rise of mantle causes partial melting.

 Tertiary crust

 Tertiary crust is more chemically- modified than either primary or secondary. It can form in several ways:

 Igneous processes: partial- melting of secondary crust, coupled with differentiation or dehydration Erosion and sedimentation: sediments derived from primary, secondary, or tertiary crust The only known example of tertiary crust is the continental crust of the Earth. It is unknown whether other terrestrial planets can be said to have tertiary crust, though the evidence so far suggests that they do not. This is likely because plate tectonics is needed to create tertiary crust, and Earth is the only planet in our Solar System with plate tectonics.

 Earth's crust

 Structure

 Plates in the crust of Earth The crust is a thin shell on the outside of the Earth, accounting for less than1% of Earth's volume. It is the top component of lithosphere: a division of Earth's layers that includes the crust and the upper part of the mantle. The lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates that move, allowing heat to escape from the interior of the Earth into space.

 The crust lies on top of the mantle, a configuration that is stable because the upper mantle is made of peridotite and so is significantly denser than the crust. The boundary between the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the Mohorovičić discontinuity, a boundary defined by a contrast in seismic velocity.

 Geologic provinces of the World( USGS) Shield Platform Orogen Basin Large igneous province Extended crust Oceanic crust:0--20 Ma20--65 Ma>65 Ma The crust of the Earth is of two distinctive types:

 Oceanic:5 km(3 mi) to10 km(6 mi) thick and composed primarily of denser, more mafic rocks, such as basalt, diabase, and gabbro. Continental:30 km(20 mi) to50 km(30 mi) thick and mostly composed of less dense, more felsic rocks, such as granite. Because both continental and oceanic crust are less dense than the mantle below, both types of crust`` float'' on the mantle. This is isostasy, and it's also one of the reasons continental crust is higher than oceanic: continental is less dense and so`` floats'' higher. As a result, water pools in above the oceanic crust, forming the oceans.

 The temperature of the crust increases with depth, reaching values typically in the range from about200° C(392° F) to400° C(752° F) at the boundary with the underlying mantle. The temperature increases by as much as30° C(54° F) for every kilometer locally in the upper part of the crust, but the geothermal gradient is smaller in deeper crust.

 Composition

 Main articles: Abundance of elements in Earth's crust and Goldschmidt classification Abundance( atom fraction) of the chemical elements in Earth's upper continental crust as a function of atomic number. The rarest elements in the crust( shown in yellow) are not the heaviest, but are rather the siderophile( iron- loving) elements in the Goldschmidt classification of elements. These have been depleted by being relocated deeper into Earth's core. Their abundance in meteoroid materials is higher. Additionally, tellurium and selenium have been depleted from the crust due to formation of volatile hydrides. The continental crust has an average composition similar to that of andesite. The most abundant minerals in Earth's continental crust are feldspars, which make up about41% of the crust by weight, followed by quartz at12%, and pyroxenes at11%. Continental crust is enriched in incompatible elements compared to the basaltic ocean crust and much enriched compared to the underlying mantle. Although the continental crust comprises only about0.6 weight percent of the silicate on Earth, it contains20% to70% of the incompatible elements.

Estimates of average density for the upper crust range between2.69 and2.74 g/ cm and for lower crust between3.0 and3.25 g/ cm.

 Formation and evolution

 Main article: Formation of the Earth Earth formed approximately4.6 billion years ago from a disk of dust and gas orbiting the newly formed Sun. It formed via accretion, where planetesimals and other smaller rocky bodies collided and stuck, gradually growing into a planet. This process generated an enormous amount of heat, which caused early Earth to melt completely. As planetary accretion slowed, Earth began to cool, forming its first crust, called a primary or primordial crust. This crust was likely repeatedly destroyed by large impacts, then reformed from the magma ocean left by the impact. None of Earth's primary crust has survived to today; all was destroyed by erosion, impacts, and plate tectonics over the past several billion years.

 Since then, Earth has been forming secondary and tertiary crust. Secondary crust forms at mid-ocean spreading centers, where partial- melting of the underlying mantle yields basaltic magmas and new ocean crust forms. This`` ridge push'' is one of the driving forces of plate tectonics, and it is constantly creating new ocean crust. That means that old crust must be destroyed somewhere, so, opposite a spreading center, there is usually a subduction zone: a trench where an ocean plate is being shoved back into the mantle. This constant process of creating new ocean crust and destroying old ocean crust means that the oldest ocean crust on Earth today is only about200 million years old.

 In contrast, the bulk of the continental crust is much older. The oldest continental crustal rocks on Earth have ages in the range from about3.7 to4.28 billion years and have been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane in Western Australia, in the Acasta Gneiss in the Northwest Territories on the Canadian Shield, and on other cratonic regions such as those on the Fennoscandian Shield. Some zircon with age as great as4.3 billion years has been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane.

 The average age of the current Earth's continental crust has been estimated to be about2.0 billion years. Most crustal rocks formed before2.5 billion years ago are located in cratons. Such old continental crust and the underlying mantle asthenosphere are less dense than elsewhere in Earth and so are not readily destroyed by subduction. Formation of new continental crust is linked to periods of intense orogeny; these periods coincide with the formation of the supercontinents such as Rodinia, Pangaea and Gondwana. The crust forms in part by aggregation of island arcs including granite and metamorphic fold belts, and it is preserved in part by depletion of the underlying mantle to form buoyant lithospheric mantle.

 Moon's crust

 Main article: Geology of the Moon A theoretical protoplanet named`` Theia'' is thought to have collided with the forming Earth, and part of the material ejected into space by the collision accreted to form the Moon. As the Moon formed, the outer part of it is thought to have been molten, a`` lunar magma ocean.'' Plagioclase feldspar crystallized in large amounts from this magma ocean and floated toward the surface. The cumulate rocks form much of the crust. The upper part of the crust probably averages about88% plagioclase( near the lower limit of90% defined for anorthosite): the lower part of the crust may contain a higher percentage of ferromagnesian minerals such as the pyroxenes and olivine, but even that lower part probably averages about78% plagioclase. The underlying mantle is denser and olivine- rich.

 The thickness of the crust ranges between about20 and120 km. Crust on the far side of the Moon averages about12 km thicker than that on the near side. Estimates of average thickness fall in the range from about50 to60 km. Most of this plagioclase- rich crust formed shortly after formation of the moon, between about4.5 and4.3 billion years ago. Perhaps10% or less of the crust consists of igneous rock added after the formation of the initial plagioclase- rich material. The best- characterized and most voluminous of these later additions are the mare basalts formed between about3.9 and3.2 billion years ago. Minor volcanism continued after3.2 billion years, perhaps as recently as1 billion years ago. There is no evidence of plate tectonics.

 Study of the Moon has established that a crust can form on a rocky planetary body significantly smaller than Earth. Although the radius of the Moon is only about a quarter that of Earth, the lunar crust has a significantly greater average thickness. This thick crust formed almost immediately after formation of the Moon. Magmatism continued after the period of intense meteorite impacts ended about3.9 billion years ago, but igneous rocks younger than3.9 billion years make up only a minor part of the crust.

According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about366.26 times.

 Earth's axis of rotation is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.

 Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by its oceans. The remaining29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.

 Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of the Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. Over99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described. Over7.4 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world has about200 sovereign states.

 Name and etymology

 The modern English word Earth developed from a wide variety of Middle English forms, which derived from an Old English noun most often spelled eorðe. It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their proto- Germanic root has been reconstructed as* erþō. In its earliest appearances, eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greekγῆ( gē): the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world( including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Terra and Gaia, Earth was a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: the Angles were listed by Tacitus as among the devotees of Nerthus, and later Norse mythology included Jörð, a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.

 Originally, earth was written in lowercase, and from early Middle English, its definite sense as`` the globe'' was expressed as the earth. By early Modern English, many nouns were capitalized, and the earth became( and often remained) the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets. House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes`` Earth'' when appearing as a name( e.g.`` Earth's atmosphere'') but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the( e.g.`` the atmosphere of the earth''). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as`` what on earth are you doing?''

 Chronology

 Main article: History of Earth Formation

 Artist's impression of the early Solar System's planetary disk The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to7000456720000000000♠4.5672±0.0006 billion years ago( Bya). By7000454000000000000♠4.54±0.04 Bya the primordial Earth had formed. The formation and evolution of Solar System bodies occurred along with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk along with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust( including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth taking10--7001200000000000000♠20 million years( Mys) to form.

 A subject of on- going research is the formation of the Moon, some4.53 Bya. A working hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars- sized object, named Theia, impacted Earth. In this scenario, the mass of Theia was approximately10% of that of Earth, it impacted Earth with a glancing blow, and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately4.1 and7000380000000000000♠3.8 Bya, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon, and by inference, to that of Earth.

 Geological history

 Main article: Geological history of Earth Hoodoos at the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing that included water vapor. The origin of the world's oceans was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids, protoplanets, and comets. In this model, atmospheric`` greenhouse gases'' kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only70% of its current luminosity. By7000350000000000000♠3.5 Bya, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.

 A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled to form a solid. The two models that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present- day forms or, more likely, a rapid growth early in Earth history followed by a long- term steady continental area. Continents formed by plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. On time scales lasting hundreds of millions of years, the supercontinents have assembled and broken apart. Roughly7002750000000000000♠750 million years ago( Mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia,600--7002540000000000000♠540 Mya, then finally Pangaea, which also broke apart7002180000000000000♠180 Mya.

 The present pattern of ice ages began about7001400000000000000♠40 Mya and then intensified during the Pleistocene about7000300000000000000♠3 Mya. High- latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every40,000--7012315576000000000♠100000 years. The last continental glaciation ended10,000 years ago.

Orange labels: known ice ages. Also see: Human timeline and Nature timeline Main articles: Abiogenesis and Evolutionary history of life Speculative phylogenetic tree of life on Earth based on rRNA analysis Chemical reactions led to the first self- replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen( O) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer( O) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in3.48 billion- year- old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in3.7 billion- year- old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, remains of biotic material found in4.1 billion- year- old rocks in Western Australia.

 During the Neoproterozoic,7002750000000000000♠750 to580 Mya, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed`` Snowball Earth'', and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity. Following the Cambrian explosion,7002535000000000000♠535 Mya, there have been five major mass extinctions. The most recent such event was7001660000000000000♠66 Mya, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as mammals, which then resembled shrews. Over the past7001660000000000000♠66 Mys, mammalian life has diversified, and several million years ago an African ape- like animal such as Orrorin tugenensis gained the ability to stand upright. This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which allowed the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues today.

 Future

 Main article: Future of Earth See also: Global catastrophic risk Earth's expected long- term future is closely tied to that of the Sun. Over the next7000110000000000000♠1.1 Bys, solar luminosity will increase by10%, and over the next7000350000000000000♠3.5 Bys by40%. The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic CO cycle, reducing its concentration to levels lethally low for plants(6995099999999999999♠10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately500--7002900000000000000♠900 Mys. The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, and animal life will become extinct. After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared and the mean global temperature will reach7002343150000000000♠70° C(7002343150000000000♠158° F). From that point, the Earth is expected to be habitable for another7016157788000000000♠500 Ma, possibly up to7016725824800000000♠2.3 Ga if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere. Even if the Sun were eternal and stable,27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.

 The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about7000500000000000000♠5 Bys. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly1 AU(150 million km;93 million mi), which is about250 times its present radius. Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit1.7 AU(250 million km;160 million mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity( peaking at about5,000 times its present level). A2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to tidal effects and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.

 Physical characteristics

 Shape

 Shape of planet Earth. Shown are distances between surface relief and the geocentre. The South American Andes summits are visible as elevated areas. Data from the Earth2014 global relief model. Main article: Figure of the Earth The shape of Earth is approximately oblate spheroidal. Due to rotation, the Earth is flattened along the geographic axis and bulging around the equator. The diameter of the Earth at the equator is43 kilometres(27 mi) larger than the pole- to- pole diameter. Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador. The average diameter of the reference spheroid is12,742 kilometres(7,918 mi). Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The maximum deviation of only0.17% is at the Mariana Trench(10,911 metres(35,797 ft) below local sea level), whereas Mount Everest(8,848 metres(29,029 ft) above local sea level) represents a deviation of0.14%.

 In geodesy, the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the geoid. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level.

Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron(88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel(5.8%), sulfur(4.5%), and less than1% trace elements.

 The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than1%. Over99% of the crust is composed of11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.

 Internal structure

 Main article: Structure of the Earth Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical( rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The thickness of the crust varies from about7003600000000000000♠6 km( kilometers) under the oceans to30--50 km for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low- viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at410 and7005660000000000000♠660 km below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core. The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by0.1--0.5° per year. The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.

 Main article: Earth's internal heat budget Earth's internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion( about20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay(80%). The major heat- producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to6,000° C(10,830° F), and the pressure could reach360 GPa. Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half- lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately7016946728000000000♠3 Ga, twice the present- day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.

A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher- temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts. More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.

 Tectonic plates

 Earth's major plates Plate name Area10 km Pacific Plate103.3 African Plate78.0 North American Plate75.9 Eurasian Plate67.8 Antarctic Plate60.9 Indo- Australian Plate47.2 South American Plate43.6 Main article: Plate tectonics The mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth, the lithosphere, is divided into pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent boundaries, at which two plates come together, divergent boundaries, at which two plates are pulled apart, and transform boundaries, in which two plates slide past one another laterally. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain- building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries. The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less- viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.

 As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than7015315576000000000♠100 Ma old in age. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and has an estimated age of7015631152000000000♠200 Ma. By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is7017127177128000000♠4030 Ma.

 The seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo- Australian, and South American. Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between50 and7001550000000000000♠55 Mya. The fastest- moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of75 mm/ year and the Pacific Plate moving52--69 mm/ year. At the other extreme, the slowest- moving plate is the Eurasian Plate, progressing at a typical rate of21 mm/ year.

 Surface

 Main articles: Lithosphere, Landform, and Extreme points of Earth Present- day Earth altimetry and bathymetry. Data from the National Geophysical Data Center. The total surface area of the Earth is about7008510000000000000♠510 million km(197 million sq mi). Of this,70.8%, or7008361130000000000♠361.13 million km(139.43 million sq mi), is below sea level and covered by ocean water. Below the ocean's surface are much of the continental shelf, mountains, volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, abyssal plains, and a globe- spanning mid-ocean ridge system. The remaining29.2%(7008148940000000000♠148.94 million km, or57.51 million sq mi) not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. Tectonics and erosion, volcanic eruptions, flooding, weathering, glaciation, the growth of coral reefs, and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape the Earth's surface over geological time.

 The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. Nearly75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about5% of the crust. The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine. Common carbonate minerals include calcite( found in limestone) and dolomite.

 The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of−418 m at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of8,848 m at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about797 metres(2,615 ft).

 The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. The total arable land is10.9% of the land surface, with1.3% being permanent cropland. Close to40% of Earth's land surface is used for cropland and pasture, or an estimated1.3×10 km of cropland and3.4×10 km of pastureland.

 Hydrosphere

 Main article: Hydrosphere Elevation histogram of Earth's surface The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the`` Blue Planet'' from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of2,000 m. The deepest underwater location is Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of10,911.4 m.

 The mass of the oceans is approximately1.35×10 metric tons or about1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of7014361800000000000♠3.618×10 km with a mean depth of7003368200000000000♠3682 m, resulting in an estimated volume of7018133200000000000♠1.332×10 km. If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be2.7 to2.8 km.

 About97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining2.5% is fresh water. Most fresh water, about68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.

 The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water(3.5% salt). Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño- Southern Oscillation.

 Atmosphere

 Main article: Atmosphere of Earth Satellite image of Earth cloud cover using NASA's Moderate- Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer The atmospheric pressure on Earth's surface averages101.325 kPa, with a scale height of about8.5 km. It has a composition of78% nitrogen and21% oxygen, with trace amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules. The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between8 km at the poles to17 km at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.

 Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved7000270000000000000♠2.7 Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen-- oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O into O. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat- retention effect, the average surface temperature would be−18° C, in contrast to the current+15° C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.

 Weather and climate Main articles: Weather and Climate Hurricane Felix seen from low Earth orbit, September2007 Lenticular cloud with a pressure ridge near Mount Discovery, Antarctica, November2013 Massive clouds above the Mojave Desert, February2016 Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three- quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first11 km(6.8 mi) of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower- density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher- density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.

 The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between30° and60°. Ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.

 Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.

 The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about0.4° C(0.7° F) per degree of latitude from the equator. Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical( or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.

 This latitudinal rule has several anomalies:

 Proximity to oceans moderates the climate. For example, the Scandinavian Peninsula has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of northern Canada. The wind enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west- to- east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean. In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east- to- west, and the eastern coasts are milder. The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies. The Earth is closest to the Sun( at perihelion) in January, which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. It is furthest away( at aphelion) in July, which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and only93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion. Despite this, there are larger land masses in the Northern Hemisphere, which are easier to heat than the seas. Consequently, summers are2.3° C(4° F) warmer in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere under similar conditions. The climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density. The commonly used Köppen climate classification system has five broad groups( humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes. The Köppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.

 The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was56.7° C(134.1° F) in Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley, in1913. The lowest air temperature ever directly measured on Earth was−89.2° C(−128.6° F) at Vostok Station in1983, but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as−94.7° C(−138.5° F) in East Antarctica. These temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on Earth.

 Upper atmosphere This view from orbit shows the full Moon partially obscured by Earth's atmosphere. Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.

 Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen- rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.

 Gravitational field

 Main article: Gravity of Earth Earth's gravity measured by NASA's GRACE mission, showing deviations from the theoretical gravity. Red shows where gravity is stronger than the smooth, standard value, and blue shows where it is weaker. The gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the Earth. Near the Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately9.8 m/ s(32 ft/ s). Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in the Earth's gravitational field, known as gravitational anomalies.

 Magnetic field

 Main article: Earth's magnetic field The main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic- field strength at the surface is3.05×10 T, with global magnetic dipole moment of7.91×10 T m. The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately700,000 years ago.

 Magnetosphere Main article: Magnetosphere Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere. The solar wind flows from left to right The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which wave propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low- energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium- energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high- energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.

 During magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.

 Orbit and rotation

 Rotation

 Main article: Earth's rotation Earth's rotation imaged by DSCOVR EPIC on29 May2016, a few weeks before the solstice Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun-- its mean solar day-- is86,400 seconds of mean solar time(86,400.0025 SI seconds). Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between0 and2 SI ms longer.

 Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service( IERS), is86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time( UT1), or23564.0989. Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox, misnamed its sidereal day, is86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time( UT1)(23564.0905). Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about8.4 ms. The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods1623--2005 and1962--2005.

 Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low- orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of15°/ h=15'/ min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.

 Orbit

 Main article: Earth's orbit The Pale Blue Dot photo taken in1990 by the Voyager1 spacecraft showing Earth( center right) from nearly6.4 billion km(4 billion mi) away Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about150 million km(93 million mi) every365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about1°/ day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes24 hours-- a solar day-- for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian. The orbital speed of Earth averages about29.78 km/ s(107,200 km/ h;66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about12,742 km(7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon,384,000 km(239,000 mi), in about3.5 hours.

 The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every27.32 days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth-- Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is29.53 days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth-- Sun plane( the ecliptic), and the Earth-- Moon plane is tilted up to±5.1 degrees against the Earth-- Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.

 The Hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of the Earth is about1.5 million kilometres(930,000 mi) in radius. This is the maximum distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit the Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

 Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about28,000 light- years from its center. It is about20 light- years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.

 Axial tilt and Seasons

 Main article: Axial tilt§ Earth Earth's axial tilt( or obliquity) and its relation to the rotation axis and plane of orbit The axial tilt of the Earth is approximately23.439281° with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and winter taking place when the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.

 Above the Arctic Circle, an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a polar night. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.

 By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices-- the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun-- and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around21 December; summer solstice is near21 June, spring equinox is around20 March and autumnal equinox is about22 or23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.

 The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of18.6 years. The orientation( rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each25,800 year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a14- month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length- of- day variation.

 In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around3 January, and its aphelion around4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth-- Sun distance causes an increase of about6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.

 Habitability

 The Rocky Mountains in Canada overlook Moraine Lake. A planet that can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not originate there. Earth provides liquid water-- an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism. The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.

 Biosphere

 Main article: Biosphere A planet's life forms inhabit ecosystems, whose total is sometimes said to form a`` biosphere''. Earth's biosphere is thought to have begun evolving about7000350000000000000♠3.5 Gya. The biosphere is divided into a number of biomes, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, height above sea level and humidity. Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic or Antarctic Circles, at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life; species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes.

 In July2016, scientists reported identifying a set of355 genes from the Last Universal Common Ancestor( LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth.

 Natural resources and land use

 Main articles: Natural resource and Land use Estimated human land use,2000 Land use Mha Cropland1,510--1,611 Pastures2,500--3,410 Natural forests3,143--3,871 Planted forests126--215 Urban areas66--351 Unused, productive land356--445 Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, only renew over geological timescales.

 Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics. These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful elements.

 Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. The land- based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land. In1980,5,053 Mha(50.53 million km) of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands,6,788 Mha(67.88 million km) was grasslands and pasture, and1,501 Mha(15.01 million km) was cultivated as croplands. The estimated amount of irrigated land in1993 was2,481,250 square kilometres(958,020 sq mi). Humans also live on the land by using building materials to construct shelters.

 Natural and Environmental hazards

 A volcano injecting hot ash into the atmosphere Large areas of Earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, or typhoons that dominate life in those areas. From1980 to2000, these events caused an average of11,800 human deaths per year. Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, sinkholes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters.

 Many localized areas are subject to human- made pollution of the air and water, acid rain and toxic substances, loss of vegetation( overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion.

 There is a scientific consensus linking human activities to global warming due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a global rise in average sea levels.

 Human geography

 Main articles: Human geography and World The seven continents of Earth North America South America Antarctica Europe Africa Asia Australia Cartography, the study and practice of map- making, and geography, the study of the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth. Surveying, the determination of locations and distances, and to a lesser extent navigation, the determination of position and direction, have developed alongside cartography and geography, providing and suitably quantifying the requisite information.

 Earth's human population reached approximately seven billion on31 October2011. Projections indicate that the world's human population will reach9.2 billion in2050. Most of the growth is expected to take place in developing nations. Human population density varies widely around the world, but a majority live in Asia. By2020,60% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas.

 It is estimated that one- eighth of Earth's surface is suitable for humans to live on-- three- quarters of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, leaving one- quarter as land. Half of that land area is desert(14%), high mountains(27%), or other unsuitable terrains. The northernmost permanent settlement in the world is Alert, on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada.(82°28′ N) The southernmost is the Amundsen-- Scott South Pole Station, in Antarctica, almost exactly at the South Pole.(90° S)

 Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City Independent sovereign nations claim the planet's entire land surface, except for some parts of Antarctica, a few land parcels along the Danube river's western bank, and the unclaimed area of Bir Tawil between Egypt and Sudan. As of2015, there are193 sovereign states that are member states of the United Nations, plus two observer states and72 dependent territories and states with limited recognition. Earth has never had a sovereign government with authority over the entire globe, although some nation- states have striven for world domination and failed.

 The United Nations is a worldwide intergovernmental organization that was created with the goal of intervening in the disputes between nations, thereby avoiding armed conflict. The U.N. serves primarily as a forum for international diplomacy and international law. When the consensus of the membership permits, it provides a mechanism for armed intervention.

 The first human to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on12 April1961. In total, about487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of30 July2010, and, of these, twelve have walked on the Moon. Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station. The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually replaced every six months. The farthest that humans have traveled from Earth is400,171 km, achieved during the Apollo13 mission in1970.

 Moon

 Characteristics Diameter3,474.8 km Mass7.349×10 kg Semi-major axis384,400 km Orbital period27 d7 h43.7 m Main article: Moon The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet- like natural satellite, with a diameter about one- quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as`` moons'', after Earth's.

 The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.

 Details of the Earth-- Moon system, showing the radius of each object and the Earth-- Moon barycenter. The Moon's axis is located by Cassini's third law. Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately38 mm/ yr. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications-- and the lengthening of Earth's day by about23μs/ yr-- add up to significant changes. During the Devonian period, for example,( approximately7002410000000000000♠410 Mya) there were400 days in a year, with each day lasting21.8 hours.

 The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.

 Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent- sized disk as the Sun. The angular size( or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also400 times more distant. This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.

 The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant- impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars- size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains( among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.

 Asteroids and artificial satellites

 Earth has at least five co-orbital asteroids, including3753 Cruithne and2002 AA29. A trojan asteroid companion,2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.

 The tiny near- Earth asteroid2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the Earth-- Moon system roughly every twenty years. During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.

 As of June2016, there were1,419 operational, human- made satellites orbiting Earth. There are also inoperative satellites, including Vanguard1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over16,000 pieces of tracked space debris. Earth's largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station.

 Cultural and historical viewpoint

 Main article: Earth in culture Earthrise, taken by astronauts on board Apollo8 The standard astronomical symbol of Earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle,, representing the four corners of the world.

 Human cultures have developed many views of the planet. Earth is sometimes personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity, and by the mid-20th century, the Gaia Principle compared Earth's environments and life as a single self- regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability. Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.

 Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat Earth was displaced by the idea of spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the6th century BC. Earth was further believed to be the center of the universe until the16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.

 Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between20 million and400 million years in1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late19th and early20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old. The perception of Earth shifted again in the20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the Apollo program.

 Jump to: navigation, search Earth's climate is largely determined by the planet's energy budget, i.e., the balance of incoming and outgoing radiation. It is measured by satellites and shown in W/ m. Earth's energy budget accounts for the balance between energy Earth receives from the Sun, and energy Earth radiates back into outer space after having been distributed throughout the five components of Earth's climate system and having thus powered the so- called`` Earth's heat engine''. This system is made up of earth's water, ice, atmosphere, rocky crust, and all living things.

 Quantifying changes in these amounts is required to accurately model the Earth's climate.

 Play media Incoming, top- of- atmosphere( TOA) shortwave flux radiation, shows energy received from the sun( Jan26--27,2012). Play media Outgoing, longwave flux radiation at the top- of- atmosphere( Jan26--27,2012). Heat energy radiated from Earth( in watts per square metre) is shown in shades of yellow, red, blue and white. The brightest- yellow areas are the hottest and are emitting the most energy out to space, while the dark blue areas and the bright white clouds are much colder, emitting the least energy. Received radiation is unevenly distributed over the planet, because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions. The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through evaporation of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation. Earth is very close to be( but not perfectly) in radiative equilibrium, the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be relatively stable. Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system-- land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere-- absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about240 watts of solar power per square meter. Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response.

 However, Earth's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors, such as atmospheric composition( mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases), the albedo( reflectivity) of surface properties, cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns.

 Changes in surface temperature due to Earth's energy budget do not occur instantaneously, due to the inertia of the oceans and the cryosphere. The net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the ocean's heat content, until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response.

 Energy budget( edit)

 A Sankey diagram illustrating the Earth's energy budget described in this section-- line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy. In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is few net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation( shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space the about same amount of energy as it receives via insolation( all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

 To quantify Earth's heat budget or heat balance, let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be100 units(100 units= about1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the albedo of Earth, around35 units are reflected back to space:27 from the top of clouds,2 from snow and ice- covered areas, and6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The65 remaining units are absorbed:14 within the atmosphere and51 by the Earth's surface. These51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation:17 directly radiated to space and34 absorbed by the atmosphere(19 through latent heat of condensation,9 via convection and turbulence, and6 directly absorbed). The48 units absorbed by the atmosphere(34 units from terrestrial radiation and14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These65 units(17 from the ground and48 from the atmosphere) balance the65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.

 Incoming radiant energy( shortwave)( edit)

 The total amount of energy received per second at the top of Earth's atmosphere( TOA) is measured in watts and is given by the solar constant times the cross-sectional area of the Earth. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere( i.e. the area of a circle), the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately340 W/ m2. Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are long- term averages, typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements.

 Of the~340 W/ m2 of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of~77 W/ m2 is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and~23 W/ m2 is reflected by the surface albedo, leaving~240 W/ m2 of solar energy input to the Earth's energy budget. This gives the earth a mean net albedo of0.29.

 Earth's internal heat and other small effects( edit)

 The geothermal heat flux from the Earth's interior is estimated to be47 terawatts. This comes to0.087 watt/ square metre, which represents only0.027% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by173,000 terawatts of incoming solar radiation.

 Human production of energy is even lower, at an estimated18 TW.

 Photosynthesis has a larger effect: photosynthetic efficiency turns up to2% of incoming sunlight into biomass, for an estimated70 TW absorbed round the year.

 Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations, including accretion of interplanetary dust and solar wind, light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, Joseph Fourier had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the greenhouse effect.

 Longwave radiation( edit)

 Main article: Outgoing longwave radiation Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing infrared energy leaving the planet. However, the atmosphere absorbs parts initially, or cloud cover can reflect radiation. Generally, heat energy is transported between the planet's surface layers( land and ocean) to the atmosphere, transported via evapotranspiration and latent heat fluxes or conduction/ convection processes. Ultimately, energy is radiated in the form of longwave infrared radiation back into space.

 Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation( the latent heat flux), offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface.

 Earth's energy imbalance( edit)

 If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux, net heat is added to or lost by the planet( if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively).

 Indirect measurement( edit)

 An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling( depending on the direction of the imbalance), and the ocean being the larger thermal reservoir on Earth, is a prime candidate for measurements.

 Earth's energy imbalance measurements provided by Argo floats have detected an accumulation of ocean heat content( OHC). The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep solar minimum of2005-2010 to be0.58±0.15 W/ m2. Later research estimated the surface energy imbalance to be0.60±0.17 W/ m2.

 Direct measurement( edit)

 Several satellites indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance. The NASA Earth Radiation Budget Experiment( ERBE) project involves three such satellites: the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite( ERBS), launched October1984; NOAA-9, launched December1984; and NOAA-10, launched September1986.

 Today NASA's satellite instruments, provided by CERES, part of the NASA's Earth Observing System( EOS), are designed to measure both solar- reflected and Earth- emitted radiation.

 Natural greenhouse effect( edit)

 Diagram showing the energy budget of Earth's atmosphere, which includes the greenhouse effect See also: Greenhouse effect The major atmospheric gases( oxygen and nitrogen) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal( infrared) radiation. However, water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and other trace gases are opaque to many wavelengths of thermal radiation. The Earth's surface radiates the net equivalent of17 percent of the incoming solar energy in the form of thermal infrared. However, the amount that directly escapes to space is only about12 percent of incoming solar energy. The remaining fraction,5 to6 percent, is absorbed by the atmosphere by greenhouse gas molecules.

 Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others. The absorption patterns of water vapor( blue peaks) and carbon dioxide( pink peaks) overlap in some wavelengths. Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor, but it absorbs energy in wavelengths(12--15 micrometres) that water vapor does not, partially closing the`` window'' through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space.( Illustration NASA, Robert Rohde) When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions. Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules; those molecules also absorb the heat, and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases. The atmosphere thins with altitude, and at roughly5--6 kilometres, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space.

 Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions, some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed. The Earth's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect. It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation( sunlight) to enter, but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves.

 Climate sensitivity( edit)

 Main article: Radiative forcing A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a radiative forcing.

 Climate sensitivity is the steady state change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget.

 Climate forcings and global warming( edit)

 Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing. Measured imbalance, close to0.6 W/ m2, implies that aerosol forcing is close to−1.6 W/ m2.( Credit: NASA/ GISS) Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall, disrupting the energy balance. Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, Milankovitch cycles( small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light- reflecting particles as high as the stratosphere. Man- made forcings include particle pollution( aerosols) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight; deforestation, which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space.

 A forcing can trigger feedbacks that intensify( positive feedback) or weaken( negative feedback) the original forcing. For example, loss of ice at the poles, which makes them less reflective, causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts, is an example of a positive feedback.

 The observed planetary energy imbalance during the recent solar minimum shows that solar forcing of climate, although natural and significant, is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing.

 In2012, NASA scientists reported that to stop global warming atmospheric CO content would have to be reduced to350 ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. The impact of anthropogenic aerosols has not been quantified, but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects.

 Global map of the flux of heat, in mW/ m, from Earth's interior to the surface. The largest values of heat flux coincide with mid ocean ridges, and the smallest values of heat flux occur in stable continental interiors. Earth's internal heat budget is fundamental to the thermal history of the Earth. The flow of heat from Earth's interior to the surface is estimated at47±2(\ displaystyle47\ pm2) terawatts( TW) and comes from two main sources in roughly equal amounts: the radiogenic heat produced by the radioactive decay of isotopes in the mantle and crust, and the primordial heat left over from the formation of the Earth.

 Earth's internal heat powers most geological processes and drives plate tectonics. Despite its geological significance, this heat energy coming from Earth's interior is actually only0.03% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by173,000 TW of incoming solar radiation. The insolation that eventually, after reflection, reaches the surface penetrates only several tens of centimeters on the daily cycle and only several tens of meters on the annual cycle. This renders solar radiation minimally relevant for internal processes.

1 Heat and early estimate of Earth's age2 Global internal heat flow3 Radiogenic heat4 Primordial heat5 Heat flow and plate tectonics6 See also7 References Heat and early estimate of Earth's age( edit)

 Based on calculations of Earth's cooling rate, which assumed constant conductivity in the Earth's interior, in1862 William Thomson( later made Lord Kelvin) estimated the age of the Earth at98 million years, which contrasts with the age of4.5 billion years obtained in the20th century by radiometric dating. As pointed out by John Perry in1895 a variable conductivity in the Earth's interior could expand the computed age of the Earth to billions of years, as later confirmed by radiometric dating. Contrary to the usual representation of Kelvin's argument, the observed thermal gradient of the Earth's crust would not be explained by the addition of radioactivity as a heat source. More significantly, mantle convection alters how heat is transported within the Earth, invalidating Kelvin's assumption of purely conductive cooling.

 Global internal heat flow( edit)

 Cross section of the Earth showing its main divisions and their approximate contributions to Earth's total internal heat flow to the surface, and the dominant heat transport mechanisms within the Earth. Estimates of the total heat flow from Earth's interior to surface span a range of43 to49 terawatts( TW)( a terawatt is10 watts). One recent estimate is47 TW, equivalent to an average heat flux of91.6 mW/ m, and is based on more than38,000 measurements. The respective mean heat flows of continental and oceanic crust are70.9 and105.4 mW/ m.

 While the total internal Earth heat flow to the surface is well constrained, the relative contribution of the two main sources of Earth's heat, radiogenic and primordial heat, are highly uncertain because their direct measurement is difficult. Chemical and physical models give estimated ranges of15--41 TW and12--30 TW for radiogenic heat and primordial heat, respectively.

 The structure of the Earth is a rigid outer crust that is composed of thicker continental crust and thinner oceanic crust, solid but plastically flowing mantle, a liquid outer core, and a solid inner core. The fluidity of a material is proportional to temperature; thus, the solid mantle can still flow on long time scales, as a function of its temperature and therefore as a function of the flow of Earth's internal heat. The mantle convects in response to heat escaping from Earth's interior, with hotter and more buoyant mantle rising and cooler, and therefore denser, mantle sinking. This convective flow of the mantle drives the movement of Earth's lithospheric plates; thus, an additional reservoir of heat in the lower mantle is critical for the operation of plate tectonics and one possible source is an enrichment of radioactive elements in the lower mantle.

 Earth heat transport occurs by conduction, mantle convection, hydrothermal convection, and volcanic advection. Earth's internal heat flow to the surface is thought to be80% due to mantle convection, with the remaining heat mostly originating in the Earth's crust, with about1% due to volcanic activity, earthquakes, and mountain building. Thus, about99% of Earth's internal heat loss at the surface is by conduction through the crust, and mantle convection is the dominant control on heat transport from deep within the Earth. Most of the heat flow from the thicker continental crust is attributed to internal radiogenic sources, in contrast the thinner oceanic crust has only2% internal radiogenic heat. The remaining heat flow at the surface would be due to basal heating of the crust from mantle convection. Heat fluxes are negatively correlated with rock age, with the highest heat fluxes from the youngest rock at mid-ocean ridge spreading centers( zones of mantle upwelling), as observed in the global map of Earth heat flow.

 Radiogenic heat( edit)

 The evolution of Earth's radiogenic heat flow over time. The radioactive decay of elements in the Earth's mantle and crust results in production of daughter isotopes and release of geoneutrinos and heat energy, or radiogenic heat. Four radioactive isotopes are responsible for the majority of radiogenic heat because of their enrichment relative to other radioactive isotopes: uranium-238( U), uranium-235( U), thorium-232( Th), and potassium-40( K). Due to a lack of rock samples from below200 km depth, it is difficult to determine precisely the radiogenic heat throughout the whole mantle, although some estimates are available. For the Earth's core, geochemical studies indicate that it is unlikely to be a significant source of radiogenic heat due to an expected low concentration of radioactive elements partitioning into iron. Radiogenic heat production in the mantle is linked to the structure of mantle convection, a topic of much debate, and it is thought that the mantle may either have a layered structure with a higher concentration of radioactive heat- producing elements in the lower mantle, or small reservoirs enriched in radioactive elements dispersed throughout the whole mantle.

Regardless, K is estimated to contribute4 TW of heating. However, due to the short half- lives the decay of U and K contributed a large fraction of radiogenic heat flux to the early Earth, which was also much hotter than at present. Initial results from measuring the geoneutrino products of radioactive decay from within the Earth, a proxy for radiogenic heat, yielded a new estimate of half of the total Earth internal heat source being radiogenic, and this is consistent with previous estimates.

 Primordial heat( edit)

 Primordial heat is the heat lost by the Earth as it continues to cool from its original formation, and this is in contrast to its still actively- produced radiogenic heat. The Earth core's heat flow-- heat leaving the core and flowing into the overlying mantle-- is thought to be due to primordial heat, and is estimated at5--15 TW. Estimates of mantle primordial heat loss range between7 and15 TW, which is calculated as the remainder of heat after removal of core heat flow and bulk- Earth radiogenic heat production from the observed surface heat flow.

 The early formation of the Earth's dense core could have caused superheating and rapid heat loss, and the heat loss rate would slow once the mantle solidified. Heat flow from the core is necessary for maintaining the convecting outer core and the geodynamo and Earth's magnetic field, therefore primordial heat from the core enabled Earth's atmosphere and thus helped retain Earth's liquid water.

 Heat flow and plate tectonics( edit)

 Earth's tectonic evolution over time from a molten state at4.5 Ga, to a single- plate lithosphere, to modern plate tectonics sometime between3.2 Ga and1.0 Ga. Controversy over the exact nature of mantle convection makes the linked evolution of Earth's heat budget and the dynamics and structure of the mantle difficult to unravel. There is evidence that the processes of plate tectonics were not active in the Earth before3.2 billion years ago, and that early Earth's internal heat loss could have been dominated by advection via heat- pipe volcanism. Terrestrial bodies with lower heat flows, such as the Moon and Mars, conduct their internal heat through a single lithospheric plate, and higher heat flows, such as on Jupiter's moon Io, result in advective heat transport via enhanced volcanism, while the active plate tectonics of Earth occur with an intermediate heat flow and a convecting mantle.

About Wikipedia Earth's magnetic field- wikipedia Earth's magnetic field

 Jump to: navigation, search Computer simulation of the Earth's field in a period of normal polarity between reversals. The lines represent magnetic field lines, blue when the field points towards the center and yellow when away. The rotation axis of the Earth is centered and vertical. The dense clusters of lines are within the Earth's core. Earth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from25 to65 microteslas(0.25 to0.65 gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle at the center of the Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo( in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).

 While the North and South magnetic poles are usually located near the geographic poles, they can wander widely over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, the Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geomagnetic poles leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors in the process of plate tectonics.

 The magnetosphere is the region above the ionosphere that is defined by the extent of the Earth's magnetic field in space. It extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into space, protecting the Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

 The Earth's magnetic field serves to deflect most of the solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. One stripping mechanism is for gas to be caught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds. Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.

 The study of past magnetic field of the Earth is known as paleomagnetism. The polarity of the Earth's magnetic field is recorded in igneous rocks, and reversals of the field are thus detectable as`` stripes'' centered on mid-ocean ridges where the sea floor is spreading, while the stability of the geomagnetic poles between reversals has allowed paleomagnetists to track the past motion of continents. Reversals also provide the basis for magnetostratigraphy, a way of dating rocks and sediments. The field also magnetizes the crust, and magnetic anomalies can be used to search for deposits of metal ores.

 Humans have used compasses for direction finding since the11th century A.D. and for navigation since the12th century. Although the magnetic declination does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass remains useful for navigation. Using magnetoception various other organisms, ranging from some types of bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation.

 Main characteristics( edit)

 Description( edit)

 At any location, the Earth's magnetic field can be represented by a three- dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the declination( D) or variation. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the inclination( I) or magnetic dip. The intensity( F) of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in X( North), Y( East) and Z( Down) coordinates.

 Common coordinate systems used for representing the Earth's magnetic field. Intensity( edit) The intensity of the field is often measured in gauss( G), but is generally reported in nanoteslas( nT), with1 G=100,000 nT. A nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma(γ). The tesla is the SI unit of the Magnetic field, B. The Earth's field ranges between approximately25,000 and65,000 nT(0.25--0.65 G). By comparison, a strong refrigerator magnet has a field of about10,000,000 nanoteslas(100 G).

 A map of intensity contours is called an isodynamic chart. As the World Magnetic Model shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the South Atlantic Anomaly over South America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of Antarctica south of Australia.

 Inclination( edit) Main article: Magnetic dip The inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between-90°( up) to90°( down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the North Magnetic Pole and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal(0°) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a dip circle.

 An isoclinic chart( map of inclination contours) for the Earth's magnetic field is shown below.

 Declination( edit) Main article: Magnetic declination Declination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/ south heading on a compass with the direction of a celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines( contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).

 Dipolar approximation( edit)

 The variation between magnetic north( N) and`` true'' north( N). See also: Dipole model of the Earth's magnetic field Near the surface of the Earth, its magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward( in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for80--90% of the field in most locations.

 Magnetic poles( edit)

 The movement of Earth's North Magnetic Pole across the Canadian arctic. The positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways: locally or globally.

 One way to define a pole is as a point where the magnetic field is vertical. This can be determined by measuring the inclination, as described above. The inclination of the Earth's field is90°( downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and-90°( upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe. They can migrate rapidly: movements of up to40 kilometres(25 mi) per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the Boothia Peninsula in1831 to600 kilometres(370 mi) from Resolute Bay in2001. The magnetic equator is the line where the inclination is zero( the magnetic field is horizontal).

 The global definition of the Earth's field is based on a mathematical model. If a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best- fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.

 Magnetosphere( edit)

 An artist's rendering of the structure of a magnetosphere.1) Bow shock.2) Magnetosheath.3) Magnetopause.4) Magnetosphere.5) Northern tail lobe.6) Southern tail lobe.7) Plasmasphere. Main article: Magnetosphere Earth's magnetic field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted further out by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's corona and accelerating to a speed of200 to1000 kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the interplanetary magnetic field( IMF).

 The solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth's atmosphere it would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth's magnetic field. The magnetopause, the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about10 Earth radii out but the other side stretching out in a magnetotail that extends beyond200 Earth radii. Sunward of the magnetopause is the bow shock, the area where the solar wind slows abruptly.

 Inside the magnetosphere is the plasmasphere, a donut- shaped region containing low- energy charged particles, or plasma. This region begins at a height of60 km, extends up to3 or4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth. There are also two concentric tire- shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high- energy ions( energies from0.1 to10 million electron volts( MeV)). The inner belt is1--2 Earth radii out while the outer belt is at4--7 Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.

 As well as deflecting the solar wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high- energy charged particles that are mostly from outside the Solar system.( Many cosmic rays are kept out of the Solar system by the Sun's magnetosphere, or heliosphere.) By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in2005 would have received a lethal dose.

 Some of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.

 The varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as space weather, are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called geomagnetic storms, can occur when a coronal mass ejection erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; the`` Halloween'' storm of2003 damaged more than a third of NASA's satellites. The largest documented storm occurred in1859. It induced currents strong enough to short out telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.

 Time dependence( edit)

 Short- term variations( edit)

 Background: a set of traces from magnetic observatories showing a magnetic storm in2000. Globe: map showing locations of observatories and contour lines giving horizontal magnetic intensity inμ T. The geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere( ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and some changes can be traced to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron- rich core.

 Frequently, the Earth's magnetosphere is hit by solar flares causing geomagnetic storms, provoking displays of aurorae. The short- term instability of the magnetic field is measured with the K- index.

 Data from THEMIS show that the magnetic field, which interacts with the solar wind, is reduced when the magnetic orientation is aligned between Sun and Earth-- opposite to the previous hypothesis. During forthcoming solar storms, this could result in blackouts and disruptions in artificial satellites.

 Secular variation( edit)

 Main article: Geomagnetic secular variation Estimated declination contours by year,1590 to1990( click to see variation). Strength of the axial dipole component of Earth's magnetic field from1600 to2020. Changes in Earth's magnetic field on a time scale of a year or more are referred to as secular variation. Over hundreds of years, magnetic declination is observed to vary over tens of degrees. A movie on the right shows how global declinations have changed over the last few centuries.

 The direction and intensity of the dipole change over time. Over the last two centuries the dipole strength has been decreasing at a rate of about6.3% per century. At this rate of decrease, the field would be negligible in about1600 years. However, this strength is about average for the last7 thousand years, and the current rate of change is not unusual.

 A prominent feature in the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a westward drift at a rate of about0.2 degrees per year. This drift is not the same everywhere and has varied over time. The globally averaged drift has been westward since about1400 AD but eastward between about1000 AD and1400 AD.

 Changes that predate magnetic observatories are recorded in archaeological and geological materials. Such changes are referred to as paleomagnetic secular variation or paleosecular variation( PSV). The records typically include long periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting geomagnetic excursions and reversals.

 Magnetic field reversals( edit)

 Geomagnetic polarity during the late Cenozoic Era. Dark areas denote periods where the polarity matches today's polarity, light areas denote periods where that polarity is reversed. Main article: Geomagnetic reversal Although generally Earth's field is approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly aligned with the rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic reversals can be found in basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies. Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than0.1 million years to as much as50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the Brunhes-- Matuyama reversal, occurred about780,000 years ago. A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, amounts to an incomplete reversal, with no change in polarity. The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age(41,000 years ago).

 The past magnetic field is recorded mostly by strongly magnetic minerals, particularly iron oxides such as magnetite, that can carry a permanent magnetic moment. This remanent magnetization, or remanence, can be acquired in more than one way. In lava flows, the direction of the field is`` frozen'' in small minerals as they cool, giving rise to a thermoremanent magnetization. In sediments, the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the magnetic field as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This is called detrital remanent magnetization.

 Thermoremanent magnetization is the main source of the magnetic anomalies around ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust on both sides of the ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.

 Radiometric dating of lava flows has been used to establish a geomagnetic polarity time scale, part of which is shown in the image. This forms the basis of magnetostratigraphy, a geophysical correlation technique that can be used to date both sedimentary and volcanic sequences as well as the seafloor magnetic anomalies.

 Studies of lava flows on Steens Mountain, Oregon, indicate that the magnetic field could have shifted at a rate of up to6 degrees per day at some time in Earth's history, which significantly challenges the popular understanding of how the Earth's magnetic field works. This finding was later attributed to unusual rock magnetic properties of the lava flow under study, not rapid field change, by one of the original authors of the1995 study.

 Temporary dipole tilt variations that take the dipole axis across the equator and then back to the original polarity are known as excursions.

 Earliest appearance( edit)

 Paleomagnetic studies of Paleoarchean lava in Australia and conglomerate in South Africa have concluded that the magnetic field has been present since at least about3,450 million years ago.

 Future( edit)

 Variations in virtual axial dipole moment since the last reversal. At present, the overall geomagnetic field is becoming weaker; the present strong deterioration corresponds to a10--15% decline over the last150 years and has accelerated in the past several years; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum35% above the modern value achieved approximately2,000 years ago. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation, as shown by the record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.

 The nature of Earth's magnetic field is one of heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone up and down in the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field( or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.

 The Earth's magnetic north pole is drifting from northern Canada towards Siberia with a presently accelerating rate--10 kilometres(6.2 mi) per year at the beginning of the20th century, up to40 kilometres(25 mi) per year in2003, and since then has only accelerated.

 Physical origin( edit)

 Main article: Dynamo theory The Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by electric currents in the conductive material of its core, created by convection currents due to heat escaping from the core. However the process is complex, and computer models that reproduce some of its features have only been developed in the last few decades.

 Earth's core and the geodynamo( edit)

 A schematic illustrating the relationship between motion of conducting fluid, organized into rolls by the Coriolis force, and the magnetic field the motion generates. The Earth and most of the planets in the Solar System, as well as the Sun and other stars, all generate magnetic fields through the motion of electrically conducting fluids. The Earth's field originates in its core. This is a region of iron alloys extending to about3400 km( the radius of the Earth is6370 km). It is divided into a solid inner core, with a radius of1220 km, and a liquid outer core. The motion of the liquid in the outer core is driven by heat flow from the inner core, which is about6,000 K(5,730° C;10,340° F), to the core- mantle boundary, which is about3,800 K(3,530° C;6,380° F). The pattern of flow is organized by the rotation of the Earth and the presence of the solid inner core.

 The mechanism by which the Earth generates a magnetic field is known as a dynamo. The magnetic field is generated by a feedback loop: current loops generate magnetic fields( Ampère's circuital law); a changing magnetic field generates an electric field( Faraday's law); and the electric and magnetic fields exert a force on the charges that are flowing in currents( the Lorentz force). These effects can be combined in a partial differential equation for the magnetic field called the magnetic induction equation:

∂ B∂ t=η∇2 B+∇×( u× B)(\ displaystyle(\ frac(\ partial\ mathbf( B))(\ partial t))=\ eta\ nabla^(2)\ mathbf( B)+\ nabla\ times(\ mathbf( u)\ times\ mathbf( B)))... where u is the velocity of the fluid; B is the magnetic B- field; andη=1/σμ is the magnetic diffusivity, which is inversely proportional to the product of the electrical conductivityσ and the permeabilityμ. The term∂ B/∂ t is the time derivative of the field;∇ is the Laplace operator and∇× is the curl operator.

 The first term on the right hand side of the induction equation is a diffusion term. In a stationary fluid, the magnetic field declines and any concentrations of field spread out. If the Earth's dynamo shut off, the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.

 In a perfect conductor(σ=∞(\ displaystyle\ sigma=\ infty\;)), there would be no diffusion. By Lenz's law, any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the frozen- in- field theorem. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.

 The motion of the fluid is sustained by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional convection. A Coriolis effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north- south polar axis.

 A dynamo can amplify a magnetic field, but it needs a`` seed'' field to get it started. For the Earth, this could have been an external magnetic field. Early in its history the Sun went through a T- Tauri phase in which the solar wind would have had a magnetic field orders of magnitude larger than the present solar wind. However, much of the field may have been screened out by the Earth's mantle. An alternative source is currents in the core- mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity. Such effects may still provide a small bias that are part of the boundary conditions for the geodynamo.

 The average magnetic field in the Earth's outer core was calculated to be25 gauss,50 times stronger than the field at the surface.

 Numerical models( edit) Simulating the geodynamo requires numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics( MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and the effect on the magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.

 The first self- consistent dynamo models, ones that determine both the fluid motions and the magnetic field, were developed by two groups in1995, one in Japan and one in the United States. The latter received attention because it successfully reproduced some of the characteristics of the Earth's field, including geomagnetic reversals.

 Currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere( edit)

 Electric currents induced in the ionosphere generate magnetic fields( ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated near where the atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields by as much as one degree. Typical daily variations of field strength are about25 nanoteslas( nT)( one part in2000), with variations over a few seconds of typically around1 nT( one part in50,000).

 Measurement and analysis( edit)

 Detection( edit)

 The Earth's magnetic field strength was measured by Carl Friedrich Gauss in1832 and has been repeatedly measured since then, showing a relative decay of about10% over the last150 years. The Magsat satellite and later satellites have used3- axis vector magnetometers to probe the3- D structure of the Earth's magnetic field. The laterØrsted satellite allowed a comparison indicating a dynamic geodynamo in action that appears to be giving rise to an alternate pole under the Atlantic Ocean west of S. Africa.

 Governments sometimes operate units that specialize in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically part of a national Geological survey, for example the British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.

 The International Real- time Magnetic Observatory Network, with over100 interlinked geomagnetic observatories around the world has been recording the earths magnetic field since1991.

 The military determines local geomagnetic field characteristics, in order to detect anomalies in the natural background that might be caused by a significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine. Typically, these magnetic anomaly detectors are flown in aircraft like the UK's Nimrod or towed as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships.

 Commercially, geophysical prospecting companies also use magnetic detectors to identify naturally occurring anomalies from ore bodies, such as the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly.

 Crustal magnetic anomalies( edit)

 A model of short- wavelength features of Earth's magnetic field, attributed to lithospheric anomalies. Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by iron artifacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt-- the iron- rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor-- contains a strongly magnetic mineral( magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as the late18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.

 Statistical models( edit)

 Each measurement of the magnetic field is at a particular place and time. If an accurate estimate of the field at some other place and time is needed, the measurements must be converted to a model and the model used to make predictions.

 Spherical harmonics( edit) See also: Multipole expansion Schematic representation of spherical harmonics on a sphere and their nodal lines. P is equal to0 along m great circles passing through the poles, and along l- m circles of equal latitude. The function changes sign each ltime it crosses one of these lines. Example of a quadrupole field. This can also be constructed by moving two dipoles together. The most common way of analyzing the global variations in the Earth's magnetic field is to fit the measurements to a set of spherical harmonics. This was first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss. Spherical harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions, one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is zero along zero or more great circles passing through the North and South Poles; the number of such nodal lines is the absolute value of the order m. The function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; this plus the order is equal to the degree l. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the Earth. A monopole is an isolated magnetic charge, which has never been observed. A dipole is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a quadrupole to two dipoles brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.

 Spherical harmonics can represent any scalar field( function of position) that satisfies certain properties. A magnetic field is a vector field, but if it is expressed in Cartesian components X, Y, Z, each component is the derivative of the same scalar function called the magnetic potential. Analyses of the Earth's magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that differ by a multiplicative factor. A least- squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the Earth's field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each multiplied by the best- fitting Gauss coefficient g or h.

 The lowest- degree Gauss coefficient, g, gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients-- g, g, and h-- determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution. The best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about10° with respect to the rotational axis, as described earlier.

 Radial dependence( edit) Spherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height( for example, ground observatories and satellites). In that case, each term with coefficient g or h can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as1/ r and one that increases with radius as r. The increasing terms fit the external sources( currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However, averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.

 The remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source( l=1) drops off as1/ r. The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off as1/ r. Quadrupole terms drop off as1/ r, and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core- mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of16, and so on. Thus, only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface. From a variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree14 or less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about2,000 kilometres(1,200 mi) or less. Smaller features are attributed to crustal anomalies.

 Global models( edit) The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy maintains a standard global field model called the International Geomagnetic Reference Field. It is updated every5 years. The11th- generation model, IGRF11, was developed using data from satellites(Ørsted, CHAMP and SAC- C) and a world network of geomagnetic observatories. The spherical harmonic expansion was truncated at degree10, with120 coefficients, until2000. Subsequent models are truncated at degree13(195 coefficients).

 Another global field model, called World Magnetic Model, is produced jointly by the United States National Centers for Environmental Information( formerly the National Geophysical Data Center) and the British Geological Survey. This model truncates at degree12(168 coefficients) with an approximate spatial resolution of3,000 kilometers. It is the model used by the United States Department of Defense, the Ministry of Defence( United Kingdom), the United States Federal Aviation Administration( FAA), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization( NATO), and the International Hydrographic Office as well as in many civilian navigation systems.

 A third model, produced by the Goddard Space Flight Center( NASA and GSFC) and the Danish Space Research Institute, uses a`` comprehensive modeling'' approach that attempts to reconcile data with greatly varying temporal and spatial resolution from ground and satellite sources.

 For users with higher accuracy needs, the United States National Centers for Environmental Information developed the Enhanced Magnetic Model( EMM), which extends to degree and order720 and resolves magnetic anomalies down to a wavelength of56 kilometers. It was compiled from satellite, marine, aeromagnetic and ground magnetic surveys. The latest version, EMM2015, includes data from The European Space Agency's Swarm satellite mission.

 Biomagnetism( edit)

 Main article: Magnetoception Animals including birds and turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, and use the field to navigate during migration. Some researchers have found that cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north- south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high- voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.

 Researchers found out that very weak electromagnetic fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals are to blame for the electromagnetic field effect on the birds, according to the new study published in the8 May2014 edition of the journal Nature. Instead, the culprits consist of frequencies between2 kHz and5 MHz, such as AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.

 Jump to: navigation, search The Earth at different points in its orbit Earth's orbit is the trajectory along which Earth travels around the Sun. The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is149.60 million km(92.96 million mi), and one complete orbit takes365.256 days(1 sidereal year), during which time Earth has traveled940 million km(584 million mi). Earth's orbit has an eccentricity of0.0167.

 As seen from Earth, the planet's orbital prograde motion makes the Sun appear to move with respect to other stars at a rate of about1°( or a Sun or Moon diameter every12 hours) eastward per solar day. Earth's orbital speed averages about30 km/ s(108,000 km/ h;67,000 mph), which is fast enough to cover the planet's diameter in7 minutes and the distance to the Moon in4 hours.

 From a vantage point above the north pole of either the Sun or Earth, Earth would appear to revolve in a counter clockwise direction around the Sun. From the same vantage point, both the Earth and the Sun would appear to rotate also in a counterclockwise direction about their respective axes.

 History of study( edit)

 Main article: Heliocentrism Heliocentric Solar System Heliocentrism( lower panel) in comparison to the geocentric model( upper panel) Heliocentrism is the scientific model that first placed the Sun at the center of the Solar System and put the planets, including Earth, in its orbit. Historically, heliocentrism is opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. Aristarchus of Samos already proposed a heliocentric model in the3rd century BC. In the16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus' De revolutionibus presented a full discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as Ptolemy had presented his geocentric model in the2nd century. This`` Copernican revolution'' resolved the issue of planetary retrograde motion by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent.`` Although Copernicus's groundbreaking book... had been( printed) over a century earlier,( the Dutch mapmaker) Joan Blaeu was the first mapmaker to incorporate his revolutionary heliocentric theory into a map of the world.''

 Influence on Earth( edit)

 Main article: Season Because of Earth's axial tilt( often known as the obliquity of the ecliptic), the inclination of the Sun's trajectory in the sky( as seen by an observer on Earth's surface) varies over the course of the year. For an observer at a northern latitude, when the north pole is tilted toward the Sun the day lasts longer and the Sun appears higher in the sky. This results in warmer average temperatures, as additional solar radiation reaches the surface. When the north pole is tilted away from the Sun, the reverse is true and the weather is generally cooler. Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle, an extreme case is reached in which there is no daylight at all for part of the year. This is called a polar night. This variation in the weather( because of the direction of the Earth's axial tilt) results in the seasons.

 Events in the orbit( edit)

 By astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the solstices-- the two points in the Earth's orbit of the maximum tilt of the Earth's axis, towards the Sun or away from the Sun-- and the equinoxes-- the two points in the Earth's orbit where the Earth's tilted axis and an imaginary line drawn from the Earth to the Sun are exactly perpendicular to one another. The solstices and equinoxes divide the year up into four approximately equal parts. In the northern hemisphere winter solstice occurs on or about December21; summer solstice is near June21; spring equinox is around March20; and autumnal equinox is about September23. The effect of the Earth's axial tilt in the southern hemisphere is the opposite of that in the northern hemisphere, thus the seasons of the solstices and equinoxes in the southern hemisphere are the reverse of those in the northern hemisphere( e.g. the northern summer solstice is at the same time as the southern winter solstice).

 In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around January3, and the aphelion around July4( for other eras, see precession and Milankovitch cycles). The changing Earth-- Sun distance results in an increase of about6.9% in total solar energy reaching the Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Since the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that the Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. However, this effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.

 The Hill sphere( gravitational sphere of influence) of the Earth is about1,500,000 kilometers(0.01 AU) in radius, or approximately4 times the average distance to the moon. This is the maximal distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects orbiting the Earth must be within this radius, otherwise they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

The orbital ellipse goes through each of the six Earth images, which are sequentially the perihelion( periapsis-- nearest point to the Sun) on anywhere from January2 to January5, the point of March equinox on March19,20, or21, the point of June solstice on June20,21, or22, the aphelion( apoapsis-- farthest point from the Sun) on anywhere from July3 to July5, the September equinox on September22,23, or24, and the December solstice on December21,22, or23. The diagram shows an exaggerated shape of Earth's orbit; the actual orbit is less eccentric than pictured.

 Because of the axial tilt of the Earth in its orbit, the maximal intensity of Sun rays hits the Earth23.4 degrees north of equator at the June Solstice( at the Tropic of Cancer), and23.4 degrees south of equator at the December Solstice( at the Tropic of Capricorn).

 Future( edit)

 Main article: Stability of the Solar System Mathematicians and astronomers( such as Laplace, Lagrange, Gauss, Poincaré, Kolmogorov, Vladimir Arnold, and Jürgen Moser) have searched for evidence for the stability of the planetary motions, and this quest led to many mathematical developments and several successive`` proofs'' of stability for the Solar System. By most predictions, Earth's orbit will be relatively stable over long periods.

 In1989, Jacques Laskar's work indicated that the Earth's orbit( as well as the orbits of all the inner planets) can become chaotic and that an error as small as15 meters in measuring the initial position of the Earth today would make it impossible to predict where the Earth would be in its orbit in just over100 million years' time. Modeling the Solar System is subject to the n- body problem.

 Jump up^ Our planet takes about365 days to orbit the Sun. A full orbit has360°. That fact demonstrates that each day, the Earth travels roughly1° in its orbit. Thus, the Sun will appear to move eastward across the sky relative to the stars by that same amount. Jump up^ For the Earth, the Hill radius is R H= a( m3 M)1/3,(\ displaystyle R_( H)= a\ left((\ frac( m)(3M))\ right)^(1/3),) where m is the mass of the Earth, a is an astronomical unit, and M is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in AU is about(13⋅332946)1/3≈0.01(\ displaystyle\ left((\ frac(1)(3\ cdot332\,946))\ right)^(1/3)\ approx0.01). Jump up^ All astronomical quantities vary, both secularly and periodically. The quantities given are the values at the instant J2000.0 of the secular variation, ignoring all periodic variations.^ Jump up to: aphelion= a×(1+ e); perihelion= a×(1-- e), where a is the semi-major axis and e is the eccentricity. Jump up^ The reference lists the longitude of perihelion, which is the sum of the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of perihelion. Subtracting from that(102.937°) the node longitude of174.873° gives−71.936°. Adding360° gives288.064°. That addition does not change the angle but expresses it in the usual0--360° range for longitudes. References( edit)
