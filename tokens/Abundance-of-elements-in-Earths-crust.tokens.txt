 Abundance of elements in Earth's crust- wikipedia Abundance of elements in Earth's crust

 Jump to: navigation, search Abundance( atom fraction) of the chemical elements in Earth's upper continental crust as a function of atomic number. The rarest elements in the crust( shown in yellow) are not the heaviest, but are rather the siderophile( iron- loving) elements in the Goldschmidt classification of elements. These have been depleted by being relocated deeper into the Earth's core. Their abundance in meteoroids is higher. Additionally, tellurium and selenium have been depleted from the crust due to formation of volatile hydrides. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust is shown in tabulated form with the estimated crustal abundance for each chemical element shown as either percentage or parts per million( ppm) by mass(10,000 ppm=1%).
