 Abundance of elements in Earth's crust- wikipedia Abundance of elements in Earth's crust

 Jump to: navigation, search Abundance( atom fraction) of the chemical elements in Earth's upper continental crust as a function of atomic number. The rarest elements in the crust( shown in yellow) are not the heaviest, but are rather the siderophile( iron- loving) elements in the Goldschmidt classification of elements. These have been depleted by being relocated deeper into the Earth's core. Their abundance in meteoroids is higher. Additionally, tellurium and selenium have been depleted from the crust due to formation of volatile hydrides. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust is shown in tabulated form with the estimated crustal abundance for each chemical element shown as either percentage or parts per million( ppm) by mass(10,000 ppm=1%).

`` Air'' redirects here. For other uses, see Air( disambiguation).`` Qualities of air'' redirects here. It is not to be confused with Air quality.

 Blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere, surrounding Earth in a visibly blue layer when seen from space on board the ISS at an altitude of335 km(208 mi). Composition of Earth's atmosphere by volume. Lower pie represents trace gases that together compose about0.038% of the atmosphere(0.043% with CO at2014 concentration). Numbers are mainly from1987, with CO and methane from2009, and do not represent any single source. The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's gravity. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention( greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night( the diurnal temperature variation).

 By volume, dry air contains78.09% nitrogen,20.95% oxygen,0.93% argon,0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around1% at sea level, and0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air content and atmospheric pressure vary at different layers, and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere and in artificial atmospheres.

 The atmosphere has a mass of about5.15×10 kg, three quarters of which is within about11 km(6.8 mi;36,000 ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. The Kármán line, at100 km(62 mi), or1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around120 km(75 mi). Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.

 The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science( aerology). Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.

 Main article: Atmospheric chemistry Mean atmospheric water vapor The three major constituents of Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor( a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air( without water vapor). The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases, among which are the greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine( elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide( SO) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.

 Earth's atmosphere Lower4 layers of the atmosphere in3 dimensions as seen diagonally from above the exobase. Layers drawn to scale, objects within the layers are not to scale. Aurorae shown here at the bottom of the thermosphere can actually form at any altitude in this atmospheric layer. Principal layers

 In general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions( see the temperature section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/ altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided( called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:

 Exosphere:700 to10,000 km(440 to6,200 miles) Thermosphere:80 to700 km(50 to440 miles) Mesosphere:50 to80 km(31 to50 miles) Stratosphere:12 to50 km(7 to31 miles) Troposphere:0 to12 km(0 to7 miles) Exosphere Main article: Exosphere The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere( i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about700 km above sea level, to about10,000 km(6,200 mi;33,000,000 ft) where it merges into the solar wind.

 This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free- moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind.

 The exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the aurora borealis and aurora australis sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.

 Thermosphere Main article: Thermosphere The thermosphere is the second- highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause( which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about80 km(50 mi;260,000 ft) up to the thermopause at an altitude range of500--1000 km(310--620 mi;1,600,000--3,300,000 ft). The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity. Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from80 to550 kilometres(50 to342 mi) above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.

 The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature inversion is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as1500° C(2700° F), though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule( of oxygen, for example) travels an average of1 kilometre(0.62 mi;3300 ft) between collisions with other molecules. Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.

 This layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between350 and420 km(220 and260 mi).

 Mesosphere Main article: Mesosphere The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about50 km(31 mi;160,000 ft) to the mesopause at80--85 km(50--53 mi;260,000--280,000 ft) above sea level.

 Temperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around−85° C(−120° F;190 K).

 Just below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar- mesospheric noctilucent clouds. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around4 to16 degrees below the horizon. Lightning- induced discharges known as transient luminous events( TLEs) occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet- powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket- powered aircraft.

 Stratosphere Main article: Stratosphere The stratosphere is the second- lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly12 km(7.5 mi;39,000 ft) above Earth's surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about50 to55 km(31 to34 mi;164,000 to180,000 ft).

 The atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly1/1000 the pressure at sea level. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation( UV) radiation from the Sun by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be−60° C(−76° F;210 K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near0° C.

 The stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather- producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet- powered aircraft.

 Troposphere Main article: Troposphere The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about12 km(7.5 mi;39,000 ft), although this altitude varies from about9 km(5.6 mi;30,000 ft) at the geographic poles to17 km(11 mi;56,000 ft) at the Equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion( i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is isothermal with height.

 Although variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere( i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing( hence, the origin of its name in the Greek wordτρόπος, tropos, meaning`` turn''). The troposphere contains roughly80% of the mass of Earth's atmosphere. The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower5.6 km(3.5 mi;18,000 ft) of the troposphere.

 Nearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather- associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller- driven aircraft.

The orange layer is the troposphere, which gives way to the whitish stratosphere and then the blue mesosphere. Other layers

 Within the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:

 The ozone layer is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer ozone concentrations are about2 to8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about15--35 km(9.3--21.7 mi;49,000--115,000 ft), though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere. The ionosphere is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. It is responsible for auroras. During daytime hours, it stretches from50 to1,000 km(31 to621 mi;160,000 to3,280,000 ft) and includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere. However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere. The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere. It has practical importance because it influences, for example, radio propagation on Earth. The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface- based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence. This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the turbopause found at about100 km(62 mi;330,000 ft), the very edge of space itself as accepted by the FAI, which places it about20 km(12 mi;66,000 ft) above the mesopause. Above this altitude lies the heterosphere, which includes the exosphere and most of the thermosphere. Here, the chemical composition varies with altitude. This is because the distance that particles can move without colliding with one another is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only near the bottom of the heterosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element. The planetary boundary layer is the part of the troposphere that is closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through turbulent diffusion. During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well- mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about100 metres(330 ft) on clear, calm nights to3,000 m(9,800 ft) or more during the afternoon in dry regions. The average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is14° C(57° F;287 K) or15° C(59° F;288 K), depending on the reference.

 Physical properties

 Comparison of the1962 US Standard Atmosphere graph of geometric altitude against air density, pressure, the speed of sound and temperature with approximate altitudes of various objects. Pressure and thickness

 Main article: Atmospheric pressure The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International Standard Atmosphere as101325 pascals(760.00 Torr;14.6959 psi;760.00 mmHg). This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres( atm). Total atmospheric mass is5.1480×10 kg(1.135×10 lb), about2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and weather.

 If the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of8.50 km(27,900 ft). It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every5.6 km(18,000 ft) or by a factor of1/ e every7.64 km(25,100 ft), the average scale height of the atmosphere below70 km(43 mi;230,000 ft). However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.

 In summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:

50% is below5.6 km(18,000 ft).90% is below16 km(52,000 ft).99.99997% is below100 km(62 mi;330,000 ft), the Kármán line. By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered astronauts. By comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at8,848 m(29,029 ft); commercial airliners typically cruise between10 and13 km(33,000 and43,000 ft) where the thinner air improves fuel economy; weather balloons reach30.4 km(100,000 ft) and above; and the highest X-15 flight in1963 reached108.0 km(354,300 ft).

 Even above the Kármán line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur. Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below100 km and extend beyond500 km. By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at350--400 km, within the F- layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as700--800 km.

 Temperature and speed of sound

 Main articles: Atmospheric temperature and Speed of sound Temperature trends in two thick layers of the atmosphere as measured between January1979 and December2005 by Microwave Sounding Units and Advanced Microwave Sounding Units on NOAA weather satellites. The instruments record microwaves emitted from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. Source: The division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above11 km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the stratosphere, starting above about20 km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly- named thermosphere above90 km.

 Because in an ideal gas of constant composition the speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile( see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.

 Density and mass

 Temperature and mass density against altitude from the NRLMSISE-00 standard atmosphere model( the eight dotted lines in each`` decade'' are at the eight cubes8,27,64,...,729) Main article: Density of air The density of air at sea level is about1.2 kg/ m(1.2 g/ L,0.0012 g/ cm). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air( a form of the ideal gas law). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.

 The average mass of the atmosphere is about5 quadrillion(5×10) tonnes or1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research,`` The total mean mass of the atmosphere is5.1480×10 kg with an annual range due to water vapor of1.2 or1.5×10 kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as1.27×10 kg and the dry air mass as5.1352±0.0003×10 kg.''

Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we can not see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.

 Scattering

 Main article: Scattering When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you can not see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter( blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer( red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.

 Absorption

 Main article: Absorption( electromagnetic radiation) Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric transmittance( or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light. Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O and O absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than300 nanometers. Water( H O) absorbs many wavelengths above700 nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.

 The combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave`` windows'' of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The optical window runs from around300 nm( ultraviolet- C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum( commonly called light), at roughly400--700 nm and continues to the infrared to around1100 nm. There are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven- meter waves.

 Emission

 Main article: Emission( electromagnetic radiation) Emission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their`` black body'' emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately6,000 K(5,730° C;10,340° F), its radiation peaks near500 nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately290 K(17° C;62° F), so its radiation peaks near10,000 nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.

 Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds( H O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.

 The greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are CO and H O.

 Refractive index

 See also: Scintillation( astronomy) The refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth's surface.

 The refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the mirage.

 Circulation

 Main article: Atmospheric circulation An idealised view of three large circulation cells. Atmospheric circulation is the large- scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means( with ocean circulation) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large- scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.

 Evolution of Earth's atmosphere

 See also: History of Earth and Paleoclimatology Earliest atmosphere

 The first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants( Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia.

 Second atmosphere

 Outgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases. A major part of carbon- dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments. Water- related sediments have been found that date from as early as3.8 billion years ago.

 About3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable`` second atmosphere''. The influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life- forms appear as early as3.5 billion years ago. How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the`` faint young Sun paradox''.

 The geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth-- with the exception of one cold glacial phase about2.4 billion years ago. In the late Archean Eon an oxygen- containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing cyanobacteria( see Great Oxygenation Event), which have been found as stromatolite fossils from2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy( isotope ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as4 billion years ago.

 Ancient sediments in the Gabon dating from between about2,150 and2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion.

 Third atmosphere

 Oxygen content of the atmosphere over the last billion years The constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long- term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations.

 Before this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen. This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere. O showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than15% by the end of the Precambrian. The following time span from541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon, during the earliest period of which, the Cambrian, oxygen- requiring metazoan life forms began to appear.

 The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last600 million years, reaching a peak of about30% around280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen. Breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains21% oxygen, which is great enough for this rapid development of animals.

 Air pollution

 Main article: Air pollution Air pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms. Stratospheric ozone depletion is caused by air pollution, chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone- depleting substances.

 The scientific consensus is that the anthropogenic greenhouse gases currently accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of global warming.

Following the peak in vegetation, the drawdown of atmospheric CO due to photosynthesis is apparent, particularly over the boreal forests. Images from space

 On October19,2015 NASA started a website containing daily images of the full sunlit side of Earth on http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/. The images are taken from the Deep Space Climate Observatory( DSCOVR) and show Earth as it rotates during a day.

 Blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere, giving Earth a blue halo when seen from space. The geomagnetic storms cause beautiful displays of aurora across the atmosphere. Limb view, of Earth's atmosphere. Colors roughly denote the layers of the atmosphere. This image shows the Moon at the centre, with the limb of Earth near the bottom transitioning into the orange- colored troposphere. The troposphere ends abruptly at the tropopause, which appears in the image as the sharp boundary between the orange- and blue- colored atmosphere. The silvery- blue noctilucent clouds extend far above Earth's troposphere. Earth's atmosphere backlit by the Sun in an eclipse observed from deep space onboard Apollo12 in1969. See also

 Jump to: navigation, search This article is about the astronomical concept. For precession of the axes outside of astronomy, see Precession. For other types of astronomical precession, see Precession§ Astronomy. Precessional movement of Earth. Earth rotates( white arrows) once a day around its rotational axis( red); this axis itself rotates slowly( white circle), completing a rotation in approximately26,000 years In astronomy, axial precession is a gravity- induced, slow, and continuous change in the orientation of an astronomical body's rotational axis. In particular, it can refer to the gradual shift in the orientation of Earth's axis of rotation, which, similar to a wobbling top, traces out a pair of cones joined at their apices in a cycle of approximately26,000 years. The term`` precession'' typically refers only to this largest part of the motion; other changes in the alignment of Earth's axis-- nutation and polar motion-- are much smaller in magnitude.

 Earth's precession was historically called the precession of the equinoxes, because the equinoxes moved westward along the ecliptic relative to the fixed stars, opposite to the yearly motion of the Sun along the ecliptic. This term is still used in non-technical discussions, that is, when detailed mathematics are absent. Historically, the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes is usually attributed in the west to the Hellenistic- era( second- century BCE) astronomer, Hipparchus, although there are claims of its earlier discovery, such as in the Indian text, Vedanga Jyotisha, dating from700 BC. With improvements in the ability to calculate the gravitational force between and among planets during the first half of the nineteenth century, it was recognized that the ecliptic itself moved slightly, which was named planetary precession, as early as1863, while the dominant component was named lunisolar precession. Their combination was named general precession, instead of precession of the equinoxes.

 Lunisolar precession is caused by the gravitational forces of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge, causing Earth's axis to move with respect to inertial space. Planetary precession( an advance) is due to the small angle between the gravitational force of the other planets on Earth and its orbital plane( the ecliptic), causing the plane of the ecliptic to shift slightly relative to inertial space. Lunisolar precession is about500 times greater than planetary precession. In addition to the Moon and Sun, the other planets also cause a small movement of Earth's axis in inertial space, making the contrast in the terms lunisolar versus planetary misleading, so in2006 the International Astronomical Union recommended that the dominant component be renamed the precession of the equator, and the minor component be renamed precession of the ecliptic, but their combination is still named general precession. Many references to the old terms exist in publications predating the change.

 Precession nomenclature( edit)

 Etymologically,`` precession'' and`` procession'' are both terms that relate to motion.`` Precession'' is derived from the Latin praecedere,`` to precede, to come before or earlier''), while`` procession'' is derived from the Latin procedere,`` to march forward, to advance''). Generally the term`` procession'' is used to describe a group of objects moving forward. The stars viewed from Earth are seen to proceed in a procession from east to west daily, due to the Earth's diurnal motion, and yearly, due to the Earth's revolution around the Sun. At the same time the stars can be observed to anticipate slightly such motion, at the rate of approximately50 arc seconds per year, a phenomenon known as the`` precession of the equinoxes''.

 In describing this motion astronomers generally have shortened the term to simply`` precession''. In describing the cause of the motion physicists have also used the term`` precession'', which has led to some confusion between the observable phenomenon and its cause, which matters because in astronomy, some precessions are real and others are apparent. This issue is further obfuscated by the fact that many astronomers are physicists or astrophysicists.

 It should be noted that the term`` precession'' used in astronomy generally describes the observable precession of the equinox( the stars moving retrograde across the sky), whereas the term`` precession'' as used in physics, generally describes a mechanical process.

 Effects( edit)

 The coincidence of the annual cycles of the apses( closest and further approach to the sun) and calendar dates( with seasons noted) at four equally spaced stages of precessionary26,000- year- cycle. The season dates are those in the north. The tilt of Earth's axis and the eccentricity of its orbit are exaggerated. Approximate estimates. Effects of weak planetary precession on the stages shown are ignored. The precession of the Earth's axis has a number of observable effects. First, the positions of the south and north celestial poles appear to move in circles against the space- fixed backdrop of stars, completing one circuit in approximately26,000 years. Thus, while today the star Polaris lies approximately at the north celestial pole, this will change over time, and other stars will become the`` north star''. In approximately3200 years, the star Gamma Cephei in the Cepheus constellation will succeed Polaris for this position. The south celestial pole currently lacks a bright star to mark its position, but over time precession also will cause bright stars to become south stars. As the celestial poles shift, there is a corresponding gradual shift in the apparent orientation of the whole star field, as viewed from a particular position on Earth.

 Secondly, the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun at the solstices, equinoxes, or other time defined relative to the seasons, slowly changes. For example, suppose that the Earth's orbital position is marked at the summer solstice, when the Earth's axial tilt is pointing directly toward the Sun. One full orbit later, when the Sun has returned to the same apparent position relative to the background stars, the Earth's axial tilt is not now directly toward the Sun: because of the effects of precession, it is a little way`` beyond'' this. In other words, the solstice occurred a little earlier in the orbit. Thus, the tropical year, measuring the cycle of seasons( for example, the time from solstice to solstice, or equinox to equinox), is about20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year, which is measured by the Sun's apparent position relative to the stars. After about26000 years the difference amounts to a full year, so the positions of the seasons relative to the orbit are`` back where they started''.( Other effects also slowly change the shape and orientation of the Earth's orbit, and these, in combination with precession, create various cycles of differing periods; see also Milankovitch cycles. The magnitude of the Earth's tilt, as opposed to merely its orientation, also changes slowly over time, but this effect is not attributed directly to precession.)

 For identical reasons, the apparent position of the Sun relative to the backdrop of the stars at some seasonally fixed time slowly regresses a full360° through all twelve traditional constellations of the zodiac, at the rate of about50.3 seconds of arc per year, or1 degree every71.6 years.

 At present, the rate of precession corresponds to a period of25,772 years, but the rate itself varies somewhat with time( see Values below), so one can not say that in exactly25,772 years the earth's axis will be back to where it is now.

 For further details, see Changing pole stars and Polar shift and equinoxes shift, below.

 History( edit)

 Hellenistic World( edit)

 Hipparchus( edit) Though there is still- controversial evidence that Aristarchus of Samos possessed distinct values for the sidereal and tropical years as early as c.280 BC, the discovery of precession usually is attributed to Hipparchus(190--120 BC) of Rhodes or Nicaea, a Greek astronomer. According to Ptolemy's Almagest, Hipparchus measured the longitude of Spica and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, Timocharis(320--260 BC) and Aristillus(~280 BC), he concluded that Spica had moved2° relative to the autumnal equinox. He also compared the lengths of the tropical year( the time it takes the Sun to return to an equinox) and the sidereal year( the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving(`` precessing'') through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than1° in a century, in other words, completing a full cycle in no more than36000 years.

 Virtually all of the writings of Hipparchus are lost, including his work on precession. They are mentioned by Ptolemy, who explains precession as the rotation of the celestial sphere around a motionless Earth. It is reasonable to presume that Hipparchus, similarly to Ptolemy, thought of precession in geocentric terms as a motion of the heavens, rather than of the Earth.

 Ptolemy( edit) The first astronomer known to have continued Hipparchus's work on precession is Ptolemy in the second century AD. Ptolemy measured the longitudes of Regulus, Spica, and other bright stars with a variation of Hipparchus's lunar method that did not require eclipses. Before sunset, he measured the longitudinal arc separating the Moon from the Sun. Then, after sunset, he measured the arc from the Moon to the star. He used Hipparchus's model to calculate the Sun's longitude, and made corrections for the Moon's motion and its parallax( Evans1998, pp.251--255). Ptolemy compared his own observations with those made by Hipparchus, Menelaus of Alexandria, Timocharis, and Agrippa. He found that between Hipparchus's time and his own( about265 years), the stars had moved2°40', or1° in100 years(36'' per year; the rate accepted today is about50'' per year or1° in72 years). He also confirmed that precession affected all fixed stars, not just those near the ecliptic, and his cycle had the same period of36,000 years as found by Hipparchus.

 Other authors( edit) Most ancient authors did not mention precession and, perhaps, did not know of it. For instance, Proclus rejected precession, while Theon of Alexandria, a commentator on Ptolemy in the fourth century, accepted Ptolemy's explanation. Theon also reports an alternate theory:

 According to certain opinions ancient astrologers believe that from a certain epoch the solstitial signs have a motion of8° in the order of the signs, after which they go back the same amount...( Dreyer1958, p.204) Instead of proceeding through the entire sequence of the zodiac, the equinoxes`` trepidated'' back and forth over an arc of8°. The theory of trepidation is presented by Theon as an alternative to precession.

 Alternative discovery theories( edit)

 Babylonians( edit) Various assertions have been made that other cultures discovered precession independently of Hipparchus. According to Al- Battani, the Chaldean astronomers had distinguished the tropical and sidereal year so that by approximately330 BC, they would have been in a position to describe precession, if inaccurately, but such claims generally are regarded as unsupported.

 Maya( edit) The archaeologist Susan Milbrath has speculated that the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar of``30,000 years involving the Pleiades... may have been an effort to calculate the precession of the equinox.'' This view is held by few other professional scholars of Mayan civilization.

 Ancient Egyptians( edit) Similar claims have been made that precession was known in Ancient Egypt during the dynastic era, prior to the time of Hipparchus( Ptolemaic period). However, these claims remain controversial. Some buildings in the Karnak temple complex, for instance, allegedly were oriented toward the point on the horizon where certain stars rose or set at key times of the year. Nonetheless, they kept accurate calendars and if they recorded the date of the temple reconstructions it would be a fairly simple matter to plot the rough precession rate. The Dendera Zodiac, a star- map from the Hathor temple at Dendera from a late( Ptolemaic) age, allegedly records precession of the equinoxes( Tompkins1971). In any case, if the ancient Egyptians knew of precession, their knowledge is not recorded as such in any of their surviving astronomical texts.

 Michael Rice wrote in his Egypt's Legacy,`` Whether or not the ancients knew of the mechanics of the Precession before its definition by Hipparchos the Bithynian in the second century BC is uncertain, but as dedicated watchers of the night sky they could not fail to be aware of its effects.''( p.128) Rice believes that`` the Precession is fundamental to an understanding of what powered the development of Egypt''( p.10), to the extent that`` in a sense Egypt as a nation- state and the king of Egypt as a living god are the products of the realisation by the Egyptians of the astronomical changes effected by the immense apparent movement of the heavenly bodies which the Precession implies.''( p.56). Rice says that`` the evidence that the most refined astronomical observation was practised in Egypt in the third millennium BC( and probably even before that date) is clear from the precision with which the Pyramids at Giza are aligned to the cardinal points, a precision which could only have been achieved by their alignment with the stars.''( p.31) The Egyptians also, says Rice, were`` to alter the orientation of a temple when the star on whose position it had originally been set moved its position as a consequence of the Precession, something which seems to have happened several times during the New Kingdom.''( p.170)

 Indian views( edit)

 Main article: Ayanamsa Indian astrologers were aware of axial precession since before the Common Era. Although many of the astronomical texts stored in Taxila were burnt during Muslim invasion of India, the classic astronomical text Suryasiddhanta survived and contains references about ayana movements. In a later commentary on Suryasiddhanta around twelfth century, Bhāskara II says:`` sampāt revolves negatively30000 times in a Kalpa of4320 million years according to Suryasiddhanta, while Munjāla and others say ayana moves forward199669 in a Kalpa, and one should combine the two, before ascertaining declension, ascensional difference, etc.'' Lancelot Wilkinson translated the last of these three verses in a too concise manner to convey the full meaning, and skipped the portion combine the two which the modern Hindu commentary has brought to the fore. According to the Hindu commentary, the final value of period of precession should be obtained by combining+199669 revolutions of ayana with−30000 revolutions of sampaat, to get+169669 per Kalpa, i.e. one revolution in25461 years, which is near the modern value of25771 years.

 Moreover, Munjāla's value gives a period of21636 years for ayana's motion, which is the modern value of precession when anomalistic precession also is taken into account. The latter has a period of136000 years now, but Bhāskar- II gives its value at144000 years(30000 in a Kalpa), calling it sampāt. Bhāskar- II did not give any name of the final term after combining the negative sampāt with the positive ayana. The value he gave indicates, however, that by ayana he meant precession on account of the combined influence of orbital and anomalistic precessions, and by sampāt he meant the anomalistic period, but defined it as equinox. His language is a bit confused, which he clarified in his own Vāsanābhāshya commentary Siddhānta Shiromani, by saying that Suryasiddhanta was not available and he was writing on the basis of hearsay. Bhāskar- II did not give his own opinion, he merely cited Suryasiddhanta, Munjāla, and unnamed`` others''.

 Extant Suryasiddhanta supports the notion of trepidation within a range of±27° at the rate of54'' per year according to traditional commentators, but Burgess opined that the original meaning must have been of a cyclical motion, for which he quoted the Suryasiddhanta mentioned by Bhāskar II.

 Chinese Astronomy( edit)

 Yu Xi( fourth century AD) was the first Chinese astronomer to mention precession. He estimated the rate of precession as1° in50 years( Pannekoek1961, p.92).

 Middle Ages and renaissance( edit)

 In medieval Islamic astronomy, precession was known based on Ptolemy's Almagest, and by observations that refined the value.

 Al- Battani, in his Zij Al- Sabi', after mentioning Hipparchus calculating precession, and Ptolemy's value of1 degree per100 solar years, says that he measured precession and found it to be on degree per66 solar years.

 Subsequently, Al- Sufi mentions the same values in his Book of Fixed Stars, that Ptolemy's value for precession is1 degree per100 solar years. He then quotes a different value from Zij Al Mumtahan, which was done during Al- Ma'mun's reign, as1 degree for every66 solar years. He also quotes the aforementioned Al- Battani's Zij Al- Sabi' as adjusting coordinates for stars by11 degrees and10 minutes of arc to account for the difference between Al- Battani's time and Ptolemy's.

 Later, the Zij- i Ilkhani compiled at the Maragheh observatory sets the precession of the equinoxes at51 arc seconds per annum, which is very close to the modern value of50.2 arc seconds.

 In the Middle Ages, Islamic and Latin Christian astronomers treated`` trepidation'' as a motion of the fixed stars to be added to precession. This theory is commonly attributed to the Arab astronomer Thabit ibn Qurra, but the attribution has been contested in modern times. Nicolaus Copernicus published a different account of trepidation in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium(1543). This work makes the first definite reference to precession as the result of a motion of the Earth's axis. Copernicus characterized precession as the third motion of the Earth.

 Modern period( edit)

 Over a century later precession was explained in Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica(1687), to be a consequence of gravitation( Evans1998, p.246). Newton's original precession equations did not work, however, and were revised considerably by Jean le Rond d'Alembert and subsequent scientists.

 Hipparchus's discovery( edit)

 Hipparchus gave an account of his discovery in On the Displacement of the Solsticial and Equinoctial Points( described in Almagest III.1 and VII.2). He measured the ecliptic longitude of the star Spica during lunar eclipses and found that it was about6° west of the autumnal equinox. By comparing his own measurements with those of Timocharis of Alexandria( a contemporary of Euclid, who worked with Aristillus early in the3rd century BC), he found that Spica's longitude had decreased by about2° in the meantime( exact years are not mentioned in Almagest). Also in VII.2, Ptolemy gives more precise observations of two stars, including Spica and concludes that in each case a2°:40' change occurred during128 BC and AD139( hence,1° per century or one full cycle in36000 years, that is, the precessional period of Hipparchus as reported by Ptolemy; cf. page328 in Toomer's translation of Almagest,1998 edition)). He also noticed this motion in other stars. He speculated that only the stars near the zodiac shifted over time. Ptolemy called this his`` first hypothesis''( Almagest VII.1), but did not report any later hypothesis Hipparchus might have devised. Hipparchus apparently limited his speculations, because he had only a few older observations, which were not very reliable.

 Why did Hipparchus need a lunar eclipse to measure the position of a star? The equinoctial points are not marked in the sky, so he needed the Moon as a reference point. Hipparchus already had developed a way to calculate the longitude of the Sun at any moment. A lunar eclipse happens during Full moon, when the Moon is in opposition. At the midpoint of the eclipse, the Moon is precisely180° from the Sun. Hipparchus is thought to have measured the longitudinal arc separating Spica from the Moon. To this value, he added the calculated longitude of the Sun, plus180° for the longitude of the Moon. He did the same procedure with Timocharis' data( Evans1998, p.251). Observations such as these eclipses, incidentally, are the main source of data about when Hipparchus worked, since other biographical information about him is minimal. The lunar eclipses he observed, for instance, took place on April21,146 BC, and March21,135 BC( Toomer1984, p.135 n.14).

 Hipparchus also studied precession in On the Length of the Year. Two kinds of year are relevant to understanding his work. The tropical year is the length of time that the Sun, as viewed from the Earth, takes to return to the same position along the ecliptic( its path among the stars on the celestial sphere). The sidereal year is the length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position with respect to the stars of the celestial sphere. Precession causes the stars to change their longitude slightly each year, so the sidereal year is longer than the tropical year. Using observations of the equinoxes and solstices, Hipparchus found that the length of the tropical year was365+1/4−1/300 days, or365.24667 days( Evans1998, p.209). Comparing this with the length of the sidereal year, he calculated that the rate of precession was not less than1° in a century. From this information, it is possible to calculate that his value for the sidereal year was365+1/4+1/144 days( Toomer1978, p.218). By giving a minimum rate he may have been allowing for errors in observation.

 To approximate his tropical year Hipparchus created his own lunisolar calendar by modifying those of Meton and Callippus in On Intercalary Months and Days( now lost), as described by Ptolemy in the Almagest III.1( Toomer1984, p.139). The Babylonian calendar used a cycle of235 lunar months in19 years since499 BC( with only three exceptions before380 BC), but it did not use a specified number of days. The Metonic cycle(432 BC) assigned6,940 days to these19 years producing an average year of365+1/4+1/76 or365.26316 days. The Callippic cycle(330 BC) dropped one day from four Metonic cycles(76 years) for an average year of365+1/4 or365.25 days. Hipparchus dropped one more day from four Callippic cycles(304 years), creating the Hipparchic cycle with an average year of365+1/4−1/304 or365.24671 days, which was close to his tropical year of365+1/4−1/300 or365.24667 days.

 We find Hipparchus's mathematical signatures in the Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient astronomical computer of the second century BC. The mechanism is based on a solar year, the Metonic Cycle, which is the period the Moon reappears in the same star in the sky with the same phase( full Moon appears at the same position in the sky approximately in19 years), the Callipic cycle( which is four Metonic cycles and more accurate), the Saros cycle and the Exeligmos cycles( three Saros cycles for the accurate eclipse prediction). The study of the Antikythera Mechanism proves that the ancients have been using very accurate calendars based on all the aspects of solar and lunar motion in the sky. In fact, the Lunar Mechanism which is part of the Antikythera Mechanism depicts the motion of the Moon and its phase, for a given time, using a train of four gears with a pin and slot device which gives a variable lunar velocity that is very close to the second law of Kepler, i.e. it takes into account the fast motion of the Moon at perigee and slower motion at apogee. This discovery proves that Hipparchus mathematics were much more advanced than Ptolemy describes in his books, as it is evident that he developed a good approximation of Kepler ́ s second law.

 Mithraic question( edit)

 This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.( September2017)( Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Mithraic Mysteries, colloquially also known as Mithraism, was a1st--4th century neo-platonic mystery cult of the Roman god Mithras. The near- total lack of written descriptions or scripture necessitates a reconstruction of beliefs and practices from the archaeological evidence, such as that found in Mithraic temples( in modern times called mithraea), which were real or artificial`` caves'' representing the cosmos. Until the1970s most scholars followed Franz Cumont in identifying Mithras as a continuation of the Persian god Mithra. Cumont's continuity hypothesis, and his concomitant theory that the astrological component was a late and unimportant accretion, is no longer followed. Today, the cult and its beliefs are recognized as a product of( Greco-) Roman thought, with an astrological component even more heavily pronounced than the already very astrology- centric Roman beliefs generally were. The details, however, are debated.

 As far as axial precession is concerned, one scholar of Mithraism, David Ulansey, has interpreted Mithras as a personification of the force responsible for precession( Ulansey,1989). He argues that the cult was a religious response to Hipparchus's discovery of precession, which-- from the ancient geocentric perspective-- amounted to the discovery that the entire cosmos( i.e., the outermost celestial sphere of the fixed stars) was moving in a previously unknown way. His analysis is based on the so- called`` tauroctony'': the image of Mithras killing a bull that was located in the central place in every Mithraic temple. In the standard tauroctony, Mithras and the bull are accompanied by a dog, a snake, a raven, and a scorpion. According to Ulansey, the tauroctony is a star chart. The bull is Taurus, a constellation of the zodiac. In the astrological age that preceded the time of Hipparchus, the vernal equinox had taken place when the Sun was in the constellation of Taurus, and during that previous epoch the constellations of Canis Minor( The Dog), Hydra( The Snake), Corvus( The Raven), and Scorpius( The Scorpion)-- i.e., the constellations that correspond to the animals depicted in the tauroctony-- all lay on the celestial equator( the location of which is shifted by the precession) and thus had privileged positions in the sky during that epoch. Mithras himself represents the constellation Perseus, which is located directly above Taurus the Bull: the same location occupied by Mithras in the tauroctony image. Mithras' killing of the Bull, by this reasoning, represented the power possessed by this new god to shift the entire cosmic structure, turning the cosmic sphere so that the location of the spring equinox left the constellation of Taurus( a transition symbolized by the killing of the Bull), and the Dog, Snake, Raven, and Scorpion likewise lost their privileged positions on the celestial equator.

 The iconography also contains two torch- bearing twins( Cautes and Cautopates) framing the bull- slaying image-- one holding a torch pointing up and the other a torch pointing down. These torch- bearers are sometimes depicted with one of them( torch up) holding or associated with a Bull and a tree with leaves, and the other( torch down) holding or associated with a Scorpion and a tree with fruit. Ulansey interprets these torch- bearers as representing the spring equinox( torch up, tree with leaves, Bull) and the autumm equinox( torch down, tree with fruit, Scorpion) in Taurus and Scorpius respectively, which is where the equinoxes were located during the preceding`` Age of Taurus'' symbolized in the tauroctony as a whole. Thus Ulansey concludes that Mithraic iconography was an`` astronomical code'' whose secret was the existence of a new cosmic divinity, unknown to those outside the cult, whose fundamental attribute was his ability to shift the structure of the entire cosmos and thereby to control the astrological forces believed at that time to determine human existence, thus giving him the power to grant his devotees success during life and salvation after death( i.e., a safe journey through the planetary spheres and a subsequent immortal existence in the realm of the stars).

 Changing pole stars( edit)

 Precession of Earth's axis around the north ecliptical pole A consequence of the precession is a changing pole star. Currently Polaris is extremely well suited to mark the position of the north celestial pole, as Polaris is a moderately bright star with a visual magnitude of2.1( variable), and it is located about one degree from the pole.

 The previous pole star was Kochab( Beta Ursae Minoris,β UMi,β Ursae Minoris), the brightest star in the bowl of the`` Little Dipper'', located16 degrees from Polaris. It held that role from1500 BC to AD500. It was not quite as accurate in its day as Polaris is today. Today, Kochab and its neighbor Pherkad are referred to as the`` Guardians of the Pole''( meaning Polaris).

 On the other hand, Thuban in the constellation Draco, which was the pole star in3000 BC, is much less conspicuous at magnitude3.67( one- fifth as bright as Polaris); today it is invisible in light- polluted urban skies.

 The brilliant Vega in the constellation Lyra is often touted as the best north star( it fulfilled that role around12,000 BC and will do so again around the year14,000); however, it never comes closer than5° to the pole.

 When Polaris becomes the north star again around27,800, due to its proper motion it then will be farther away from the pole than it is now, while in23,600 BC it came closer to the pole.

 Precession of Earth's axis around the south ecliptical pole It is more difficult to find the south celestial pole in the sky at this moment, as that area is a particularly bland portion of the sky, and the nominal south pole star is Sigma Octantis, which with magnitude5.5 is barely visible to the naked eye even under ideal conditions. That will change from the80th to the90th centuries, however, when the south celestial pole travels through the False Cross.

 This situation also is seen on a star map. The orientation of the south pole is moving toward the Southern Cross constellation. For the last2,000 years or so, the Southern Cross has pointed to the south celestial pole. As a consequence, the constellation is no longer visible from subtropical northern latitudes, as it was in the time of the ancient Greeks.

 Polar shift and equinoxes shift( edit)

 Precessional movement as seen from' outside' the celestial sphere The26,000- year cycle of precession as seen from near the Earth. The current north pole star is Polaris( top). In about8,000 years it will be the bright star Deneb( left), and in about12,000 years, Vega( left center). The Earth's rotation is not depicted to scale-- in this span of time, it should rotate over9 million times. The images above attempt to explain the relation between the precession of the Earth's axis and the shift in the equinoxes. These images show the position of the Earth's axis on the celestial sphere, a fictitious sphere which places the stars according to their position as seen from Earth, regardless of their actual distance. The first image shows the celestial sphere from the outside, with the constellations in mirror image. The second image shows the perspective of a near- Earth position as seen through a very wide angle lens( from which the apparent distortion arises).

 The rotation axis of the Earth describes, over a period of25,700 years, a small circle( blue) among the stars, centered on the ecliptic north pole( the blue E) and with an angular radius of about23.4°, an angle known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. The direction of precession is opposite to the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis. The orange axis was the Earth's rotation axis5,000 years ago, when it pointed to the star Thuban. The yellow axis, pointing to Polaris, marks the axis now.

 The equinoxes occur where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic( red line), that is, where the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the Sun and Earth.( Note that the term`` equinox'' here refers to a point on the celestial sphere so defined, rather than the moment in time when the Sun is overhead at the Equator, though the two meanings are related.) When the axis precesses from one orientation to another, the equatorial plane of the Earth( indicated by the circular grid around the equator) moves. The celestial equator is just the Earth's equator projected onto the celestial sphere, so it moves as the Earth's equatorial plane moves, and the intersection with the ecliptic moves with it. The positions of the poles and equator on Earth do not change, only the orientation of the Earth against the fixed stars.

 As seen from the orange grid,5,000 years ago, the vernal equinox was close to the star Aldebaran of Taurus. Now, as seen from the yellow grid, it has shifted( indicated by the red arrow) to somewhere in the constellation of Pisces.

 Still pictures like these are only first approximations, as they do not take into account the variable speed of the precession, the variable obliquity of the ecliptic, the planetary precession( which is a slow rotation of the ecliptic plane itself, presently around an axis located on the plane, with longitude174°.8764) and the proper motions of the stars.

 The precession of the equinoxes is caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and the Moon, and to a lesser extent other bodies, on the Earth. It was first explained by Sir Isaac Newton.

 Axial precession is similar to the precession of a spinning top. In both cases, the applied force is due to gravity. For a spinning top, this force tends to be almost parallel to the rotation axis. For the Earth, however, the applied forces of the Sun and the Moon are nearly perpendicular to the axis of rotation.

 The Earth is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid, with an equatorial diameter about43 kilometers larger than its polar diameter. Because of the Earth's axial tilt, during most of the year the half of this bulge that is closest to the Sun is off- center, either to the north or to the south, and the far half is off- center on the opposite side. The gravitational pull on the closer half is stronger, since gravity decreases with distance, so this creates a small torque on the Earth as the Sun pulls harder on one side of the Earth than the other. The axis of this torque is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the Earth's rotation so the axis of rotation precesses. If the Earth were a perfect sphere, there would be no precession.

 This average torque is perpendicular to the direction in which the rotation axis is tilted away from the ecliptic pole, so that it does not change the axial tilt itself. The magnitude of the torque from the Sun( or the Moon) varies with the gravitational object's alignment with the Earth's spin axis and approaches zero when it is orthogonal.

 Although the above explanation involved the Sun, the same explanation holds true for any object moving around the Earth, along or close to the ecliptic, notably, the Moon. The combined action of the Sun and the Moon is called the lunisolar precession. In addition to the steady progressive motion( resulting in a full circle in about25,700 years) the Sun and Moon also cause small periodic variations, due to their changing positions. These oscillations, in both precessional speed and axial tilt, are known as the nutation. The most important term has a period of18.6 years and an amplitude of9.2''.

 In addition to lunisolar precession, the actions of the other planets of the Solar System cause the whole ecliptic to rotate slowly around an axis which has an ecliptic longitude of about174° measured on the instantaneous ecliptic. This so- called planetary precession shift amounts to a rotation of the ecliptic plane of0.47 seconds of arc per year( more than a hundred times smaller than lunisolar precession). The sum of the two precessions is known as the general precession.

 Equations( edit)

 Tidal force on Earth due to the Sun, Moon, or a planet The tidal force on Earth due to a perturbing body( Sun, Moon or planet) is expressed by Newton's law of universal gravitation, whereby the gravitational force of the perturbing body on the side of Earth nearest is said to be greater than the gravitational force on the far side by an amount proportional to the difference in the cubes of the distances between the near and far sides. If the gravitational force of the perturbing body acting on the mass of the Earth as a point mass at the center of Earth( which provides the centripetal force causing the orbital motion) is subtracted from the gravitational force of the perturbing body everywhere on the surface of Earth, what remains may be regarded as the tidal force. This gives the paradoxical notion of a force acting away from the satellite but in reality it is simply a lesser force towards that body due to the gradient in the gravitational field. For precession, this tidal force can be grouped into two forces which only act on the equatorial bulge outside of a mean spherical radius. This couple can be decomposed into two pairs of components, one pair parallel to Earth's equatorial plane toward and away from the perturbing body which cancel each other out, and another pair parallel to Earth's rotational axis, both toward the ecliptic plane. The latter pair of forces creates the following torque vector on Earth's equatorial bulge:

 T→=3 G m r3( C− A) sin⁡δ cos⁡δ( sin⁡α− cos⁡α0)(\ displaystyle(\ overrightarrow( T))=(\ frac(3Gm)( r^(3)))( C-A)\ sin\ delta\ cos\ delta(\ begin( pmatrix)\ sin\ alpha\\-\ cos\ alpha\\0\ end( pmatrix))) where

 Gm= standard gravitational parameter of the perturbing body r= geocentric distance to the perturbing body C= moment of inertia around Earth's axis of rotation A= moment of inertia around any equatorial diameter of Earth C− A= moment of inertia of Earth's equatorial bulge( C> A)δ= declination of the perturbing body( north or south of equator)α= right ascension of the perturbing body( east from vernal equinox). The three unit vectors of the torque at the center of the Earth( top to bottom) are x on a line within the ecliptic plane( the intersection of Earth's equatorial plane with the ecliptic plane) directed toward the vernal equinox, y on a line in the ecliptic plane directed toward the summer solstice(90° east of x), and z on a line directed toward the north pole of the ecliptic.

 The value of the three sinusoidal terms in the direction of x( sinδ cosδ sinα) for the Sun is a sine squared waveform varying from zero at the equinoxes(0°,180°) to0.36495 at the solstices(90°,270°). The value in the direction of y( sinδ cosδ(− cosα)) for the Sun is a sine wave varying from zero at the four equinoxes and solstices to±0.19364( slightly more than half of the sine squared peak) halfway between each equinox and solstice with peaks slightly skewed toward the equinoxes(43.37°(−),136.63°(+),223.37°(−),316.63°(+)). Both solar waveforms have about the same peak- to- peak amplitude and the same period, half of a revolution or half of a year. The value in the direction of z is zero.

 The average torque of the sine wave in the direction of y is zero for the Sun or Moon, so this component of the torque does not affect precession. The average torque of the sine squared waveform in the direction of x for the Sun or Moon is:

 T x=32 G m a3(1− e2)3/2( C− A) sin⁡ε cos⁡ε(\ displaystyle T_( x)=(\ frac(3)(2))(\ frac( Gm)( a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)))( C-A)\ sin\ epsilon\ cos\ epsilon) where

 a(\ displaystyle a)= semimajor axis of Earth's( Sun's) orbit or Moon's orbit e= eccentricity of Earth's( Sun's) orbit or Moon's orbit and1/2 accounts for the average of the sine squared waveform, a3(1− e2)3/2(\ displaystyle a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)) accounts for the average distance cubed of the Sun or Moon from Earth over the entire elliptical orbit, andε(\ displaystyle\ epsilon\,\!)( the angle between the equatorial plane and the ecliptic plane) is the maximum value ofδ for the Sun and the average maximum value for the Moon over an entire18.6 year cycle.

 Precession is:

 dψ d t= T x Cω sin⁡ε(\ displaystyle(\ frac( d\ psi)( dt))=(\ frac( T_( x))( C\ omega\ sin\ epsilon))) whereω is Earth's angular velocity and Cω is Earth's angular momentum. Thus the first order component of precession due to the Sun is:

 dψ S d t=32( G m a3(1− e2)3/2) S(( C− A) C cos⁡εω) E(\ displaystyle(\ frac( d\ psi_( S))( dt))=(\ frac(3)(2))\ left((\ frac( Gm)( a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)))\ right)_( S)\ left((\ frac(( C-A))( C))(\ frac(\ cos\ epsilon)(\ omega))\ right)_( E)) whereas that due to the Moon is:

 dψ L d t=32( G m(1−1.5 sin2⁡ i) a3(1− e2)3/2) L(( C− A) C cos⁡εω) E(\ displaystyle(\ frac( d\ psi_( L))( dt))=(\ frac(3)(2))\ left((\ frac( Gm(1-1.5\ sin^(2) i))( a^(3)(1- e^(2))^(3/2)))\ right)_( L)\ left((\ frac(( C-A))( C))(\ frac(\ cos\ epsilon)(\ omega))\ right)_( E)) where i is the angle between the plane of the Moon's orbit and the ecliptic plane. In these two equations, the Sun's parameters are within square brackets labeled S, the Moon's parameters are within square brackets labeled L, and the Earth's parameters are within square brackets labeled E. The term(1−1.5 sin2⁡ i)(\ displaystyle(1-1.5\ sin^(2) i)) accounts for the inclination of the Moon's orbit relative to the ecliptic. The term( C− A)/ C is Earth's dynamical ellipticity or flattening, which is adjusted to the observed precession because Earth's internal structure is not known with sufficient detail. If Earth were homogeneous the term would equal its third eccentricity squared,

The solar equation is a good representation of precession due the Sun because Earth's orbit is close to an ellipse, being only slightly perturbed by the other planets. The lunar equation is not as good a representation of precession due to the Moon because the Moon's orbit is greatly distorted by the Sun and neither the radius nor the eccentricity is constant over the year.

 Values( edit)

 Simon Newcomb's calculation at the end of the19th century for general precession( p) in longitude gave a value of5,025.64 arcseconds per tropical century, and was the generally accepted value until artificial satellites delivered more accurate observations and electronic computers allowed more elaborate models to be calculated. Lieske developed an updated theory in1976, where p equals5,029.0966 arcseconds per Julian century. Modern techniques such as VLBI and LLR allowed further refinements, and the International Astronomical Union adopted a new constant value in2000, and new computation methods and polynomial expressions in2003 and2006; the accumulated precession is:

 p=5,028.796195× T+1.1054348× T+ higher order terms, in arcseconds, with T, the time in Julian centuries( that is,36,525 days) since the epoch of2000.

 The rate of precession is the derivative of that:

 p=5,028.796195+2.2108696× T+ higher order terms. The constant term of this speed(5,028.796195 arcseconds per century in above equation) corresponds to one full precession circle in25,771.57534 years( one full circle of360 degrees divided with5,028.796195 arcseconds per century) although some other sources put the value at25771.4 years, leaving a small uncertainty.

 The precession rate is not a constant, but is( at the moment) slowly increasing over time, as indicated by the linear( and higher order) terms in T. In any case it must be stressed that this formula is only valid over a limited time period. It is a polynomial expression centred on the J2000 datum, empirically fitted to observational data, not on a deterministic model of the solar system. It is clear that if T gets large enough( far in the future or far in the past), the T2 term will dominate and p will go to very large values. In reality, more elaborate calculations on the numerical model of the Solar System show that the precessional constants have a period of about41,000 years, the same as the obliquity of the ecliptic. Note that the constants mentioned here are the linear and all higher terms of the formula above, not the precession itself. That is,

 p= A+ BT+ CT+... is an approximation of

 p= a+ b sin(2πT/ P), where P is the41,000 year period. Theoretical models may calculate the constants( coefficients) corresponding to the higher powers of T, but since it is impossible for a( finite) polynomial to match a periodic function over all numbers, the difference in all such approximations will grow without bound as T increases. However, greater accuracy can be obtained over a limited time span by fitting a high enough order polynomial to observation data, rather than a necessarily imperfect dynamic numerical model. So for present flight trajectory calculations of artificial satellites and spacecraft, the polynomial method gives better accuracy. In that respect, the International Astronomical Union chose the best- developed available theory. For up to a few centuries in the past and the future, all formulas do not diverge very much. For up to a few thousand years in the past and the future, most agree to some accuracy. For eras farther out, discrepancies become too large-- the exact rate and period of precession may not be computed using these polynomials even for a single whole precession period.

 The precession of Earth's axis is a very slow effect, but at the level of accuracy at which astronomers work, it does need to be taken into account on a daily basis. Note that although the precession and the tilt of Earth's axis( the obliquity of the ecliptic) are calculated from the same theory and thus, are related to each other, the two movements act independently of each other, moving in opposite directions.

 Precession exhibits a secular decrease due to tidal dissipation from59``/ a to45''/ a( a= annum= Julian year) during the500 million year period centered on the present. After short- term fluctuations( tens of thousands of years) are averaged out, the long- term trend can be approximated by the following polynomials for negative and positive time from the present in``/ a, where T is in billions of Julian years( Ga):

 p=50.475838−26.368583T+21.890862T p=50.475838−27.000654T+15.603265T Precession will be greater than p by the small amount of+0.135052``/ a between+30 Ma and+130 Ma. The jump to this excess over p will occur in only20 Ma beginning now because the secular decrease in precession is beginning to cross a resonance in Earth's orbit caused by the other planets.

 According to Ward, when, in about1,500 million years, the distance of the Moon, which is continuously increasing from tidal effects, has increased from the current60.3 to approximately66.5 Earth radii, resonances from planetary effects will push precession to49,000 years at first, and then, when the Moon reaches68 Earth radii in about2,000 million years, to69,000 years. This will be associated with wild swings in the obliquity of the ecliptic as well. Ward, however, used the abnormally large modern value for tidal dissipation. Using the620- million year average provided by tidal rhythmites of about half the modern value, these resonances will not be reached until about3,000 and4,000 million years, respectively. However, due to the gradually increasing luminosity of the Sun, unless the atmosphere is artificially shielded, the oceans of the Earth will have vaporized before that time( about2,100 million years from now).

 Jump to: navigation, search`` Obliquity'' redirects here. For the book, see Obliquity( book). In astronomy, axial tilt, also known as obliquity, is the angle between an object's rotational axis and its orbital axis, or, equivalently, the angle between its equatorial plane and orbital plane. It differs from orbital inclination.

 At an obliquity of zero, the two axes point in the same direction; i.e., the rotational axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane. Earth's obliquity oscillates between22.1 and24.5 degrees on a41,000- year cycle; the earth's mean obliquity is currently23°26′12.9''( or23.43693°) and decreasing.

 Over the course of an orbit, the obliquity usually does not change considerably, and the orientation of the axis remains the same relative to the background stars. This causes one pole to be directed more toward the Sun on one side of the orbit, and the other pole on the other side-- the cause of the seasons on the Earth.

 Standards( edit)

 The positive pole of a planet is defined by the right- hand rule: if the fingers of the right hand are curled in the direction of the rotation then the thumb points to the positive pole. The axial tilt is defined as the angle between the direction of the positive pole and the normal to the orbital plane. The angles for Earth, Uranus and Venus are approximately23°,97°, and177° respectively.

 There are two standard methods of specifying tilt. The International Astronomical Union( IAU) defines the north pole of a planet as that which lies on Earth's north side of the invariable plane of the Solar System; under this system, Venus is tilted3° and spins retrograde, opposite that of most of the other planets.

 The IAU also uses the right- hand rule to define a positive pole for the purpose of determining orientation. Using this convention, Venus is tilted177°(`` upside down'').

 Earth( edit)

 Earth's axial tilt( obliquity) is currently about23.4°. Earth's orbital plane is known as the ecliptic plane, and Earth's tilt is known to astronomers as the obliquity of the ecliptic, being the angle between the ecliptic and the celestial equator on the celestial sphere. It is denoted by the Greek letterε.

 Earth currently has an axial tilt of about23.4°. This value remains about the same relative to a stationary orbital plane throughout the cycles of axial precession. But the ecliptic( i.e., Earth's orbit) moves due to planetary perturbations, and the obliquity of the ecliptic is not a fixed quantity. At present, it is decreasing at a rate of about47'' per century( see details in Short term below).

 History( edit)

 Earth's obliquity may have been reasonably accurately measured as early as1100 BC in India and China. The ancient Greeks had good measurements of the obliquity since about350 BC, when Pytheas of Marseilles measured the shadow of a gnomon at the summer solstice. About830 AD, the Caliph Al- Mamun of Baghdad directed his astronomers to measure the obliquity, and the result was used in the Arab world for many years. In1437, Ulugh Beg determined the Earth's axial tilt as23°30′17''(23.5047°).

 It was widely believed, during the Middle Ages, that both precession and Earth's obliquity oscillated around a mean value, with a period of672 years, an idea known as trepidation of the equinoxes. Perhaps the first to realize this was incorrect( during historic time) was Ibn al- Shatir in the fourteenth century and the first to realize that the obliquity is decreasing at a relatively constant rate was Fracastoro in1538. The first accurate, modern, western observations of the obliquity were probably those of Tycho Brahe from Denmark, about1584, although observations by several others, including al- Ma'mun, al- Tusi, Purbach, Regiomontanus, and Walther, could have provided similar information.

 Seasons( edit)

 Main article: Season Earth's axis remains tilted in the same direction with reference to the background stars throughout a year( regardless of where it is in its orbit). This means that one pole( and the associated hemisphere of Earth) will be directed away from the Sun at one side of the orbit, and half an orbit later( half a year later) this pole will be directed towards the Sun. This is the cause of Earth's seasons. Summer occurs in the Northern hemisphere when the north pole is directed toward the Sun. Variations in Earth's axial tilt can influence the seasons and is likely a factor in long- term climate change( also see Milankovitch cycles).

 Relationship between Earth's axial tilt(ε) to the tropical and polar circles Oscillation( edit)

 Short term( edit) Obliquity of the ecliptic for20,000 years, from Laskar(1986). The red point represents the year2000. The exact angular value of the obliquity is found by observation of the motions of Earth and planets over many years. Astronomers produce new fundamental ephemerides as the accuracy of observation improves and as the understanding of the dynamics increases, and from these ephemerides various astronomical values, including the obliquity, are derived.

 Annual almanacs are published listing the derived values and methods of use. Until1983, the Astronomical Almanac's angular value of the mean obliquity for any date was calculated based on the work of Newcomb, who analyzed positions of the planets until about1895:

ε=23°27′8.26''−46.845'' T−0.0059'' T+6997181000000000000♠0.00181'' T whereε is the obliquity and T is tropical centuries from B1900.0 to the date in question.

 From1984, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's DE series of computer- generated ephemerides took over as the fundamental ephemeris of the Astronomical Almanac. Obliquity based on DE200, which analyzed observations from1911 to1979, was calculated:

ε=23°26′21.45''−46.815'' T−0.0006'' T+6997181000000000000♠0.00181'' T where hereafter T is Julian centuries from J2000.0.

 JPL's fundamental ephemerides have been continually updated. For instance, the Astronomical Almanac for2010 specifies:

ε=23°26′21.406''−7001468367689999999♠46.836769'' T−6996183100000000000♠0.0001831'' T+6997200339999999999♠0.00200340'' T−5.76''×10 T−4.34''×10 T These expressions for the obliquity are intended for high precision over a relatively short time span, perhaps± several centuries. J. Laskar computed an expression to order T good to0.02'' over1000 years and several arcseconds over10,000 years.

ε=23°26′21.448''−4680.93'' t−1.55'' t+1999.25'' t−51.38'' t−249.67'' t−39.05'' t+7.12'' t+27.87'' t+5.79'' t+2.45'' t where here t is multiples of10,000 Julian years from J2000.0.

 These expressions are for the so- called mean obliquity, that is, the obliquity free from short- term variations. Periodic motions of the Moon and of Earth in its orbit cause much smaller(9.2 arcseconds) short- period( about18.6 years) oscillations of the rotation axis of Earth, known as nutation, which add a periodic component to Earth's obliquity. The true or instantaneous obliquity includes this nutation.

 Long term( edit) Main article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System Using numerical methods to simulate Solar System behavior, long- term changes in Earth's orbit, and hence its obliquity, have been investigated over a period of several million years. For the past5 million years, Earth's obliquity has varied between22°2′33'' and24°30′16'', with a mean period of41,040 years. This cycle is a combination of precession and the largest term in the motion of the ecliptic. For the next1 million years, the cycle will carry the obliquity between22°13′44'' and24°20′50''.

 The Moon has a stabilizing effect on Earth's obliquity. Frequency map analysis conducted in1993 suggested that, in the absence of the Moon, the obliquity can change rapidly due to orbital resonances and chaotic behavior of the Solar System, reaching as high as90° in as little as a few million years( also see Orbit of the Moon). However, more recent numerical simulations made in2011 indicated that even in the absence of the Moon, Earth's obliquity might not be quite so unstable; varying only by about20--25°. To resolve this contradiction, diffusion rate of obliquity has been calculated, and it was found that it takes more than billions of years for Earth's obliquity to reach near90°. The Moon's stabilizing effect will continue for less than2 billion years. As the Moon continues to recede from Earth due to tidal acceleration, resonances may occur which will cause large oscillations of the obliquity.

 Long- term obliquity of the ecliptic. Left: for the past5 million years; note that the obliquity varies only from about22.0° to24.5°. Right: for the next1 million years; note the approx.41,000- year period of variation. In both graphs, the red point represents the year1850.( Source: Berger,1976). Solar System bodies( edit)

 All four of the innermost, rocky planets of the Solar System may have had large variations of their obliquity in the past. Since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane, it changes as the orbital plane changes due to the influence of other planets. But the axis of rotation can also move( axial precession), due to torque exerted by the sun on a planet's equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession. If the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes. The rate varies due to tidal dissipation and core- mantle interaction, among other things. When a planet's precession rate approaches certain values, orbital resonances may cause large changes in obliquity. The amplitude of the contribution having one of the resonant rates is divided by the difference between the resonant rate and the precession rate, so it becomes large when the two are similar. Mercury and Venus have most likely been stabilized by the tidal dissipation of the Sun. Earth was stabilized by the Moon, as mentioned above, but before its capture, Earth, too, could have passed through times of instability. Mars's obliquity is quite variable over millions of years and may be in a chaotic state; it varies as much as0° to60° over some millions of years, depending on perturbations of the planets. Some authors dispute that Mars's obliquity is chaotic, and show that tidal dissipation and viscous core- mantle coupling are adequate for it to have reached a fully damped state, similar to Mercury and Venus. The occasional shifts in the axial tilt of Mars have been suggested as an explanation for the appearance and disappearance of rivers and lakes over the course of the existence of Mars. A shift could cause a burst of methane into the atmosphere, causing warming, but then the methane would be destroyed and the climate would become arid again.

 The obliquities of the outer planets are considered relatively stable.

Extrasolar planets( edit)

 Further information: Exoplanet§ Rotation and axial tilt The stellar obliquityψ, i.e. the axial tilt of a star with respect to the orbital plane of one of its planets, has been determined for only a few systems. But for49 stars as of today, the sky- projected spin- orbit misalignmentλ has been observed, which serves as a lower limit toψ. Most of these measurements rely on the Rossiter-- McLaughlin effect. So far, it has not been possible to constrain the obliquity of an extrasolar planet. But the rotational flattening of the planet and the entourage of moons and/ or rings, which are traceable with high- precision photometry, e.g. by the space- based Kepler spacecraft, could provide access toψ in the near future.

 Astrophysicists have applied tidal theories to predict the obliquity of extrasolar planets. It has been shown that the obliquities of exoplanets in the habitable zone around low- mass stars tend to be eroded in less than10 years, which means that they would not have seasons as Earth has.

 Jump to: navigation, search For the thermonuclear reaction involving carbon that powers some stars, see CNO cycle. For organic chemical ring- shaped structures, see Cyclic compounds. Movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and ocean in billions of tons per year. Yellow numbers are natural fluxes, red are human contributions, white are stored carbon. The effects of volcanic and tectonic activity are not included. The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth. Carbon is the main component of biological compounds as well as a major component of many minerals such as limestone. Along with the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle, the carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to make Earth capable of sustaining life. It describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere, as well as long- term processes of carbon sequestration to and release from carbon sinks.

 The carbon cycle was initially discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, and popularized by Humphry Davy.

 The atmosphere The terrestrial biosphere The ocean, including dissolved inorganic carbon and living and non-living marine biota The sediments, including fossil fuels, fresh water systems and non-living organic material. The Earth's interior( mantle and crust. These carbon stores interact with the other components through geological processes. The carbon exchanges between reservoirs occur as the result of various chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes. The ocean contains the largest active pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth. The natural flows of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial ecosystems, and sediments is fairly balanced, so that carbon levels would be roughly stable without human influence.

 Atmosphere( edit)

 Main article: Atmospheric carbon cycle Epiphytes on electric wires. This kind of plant takes both CO and water from the atmosphere for living and growing. Carbon in the Earth's atmosphere exists in two main forms: carbon dioxide and methane. Both of these gases absorb and retain heat in the atmosphere and are partially responsible for the greenhouse effect. Methane produces a larger greenhouse effect per volume as compared to carbon dioxide, but it exists in much lower concentrations and is more short- lived than carbon dioxide, making carbon dioxide the more important greenhouse gas of the two.

 Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere primarily through photosynthesis and enters the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres. Carbon dioxide also dissolves directly from the atmosphere into bodies of water( ocean, lakes, etc.), as well as dissolving in precipitation as raindrops fall through the atmosphere. When dissolved in water, carbon dioxide reacts with water molecules and forms carbonic acid, which contributes to ocean acidity. It can then be absorbed by rocks through weathering. It also can acidify other surfaces it touches or be washed into the ocean.

 Human activities over the past two centuries have significantly increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, mainly in the form of carbon dioxide, both by modifying ecosystems' ability to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and by emitting it directly, e.g., by burning fossil fuels and manufacturing concrete.

 Terrestrial biosphere( edit)

 Main article: Terrestrial biological carbon cycle A portable soil respiration system measuring soil CO flux The terrestrial biosphere includes the organic carbon in all land- living organisms, both alive and dead, as well as carbon stored in soils. About500 gigatons of carbon are stored above ground in plants and other living organisms, while soil holds approximately1,500 gigatons of carbon. Most carbon in the terrestrial biosphere is organic carbon, while about a third of soil carbon is stored in inorganic forms, such as calcium carbonate. Organic carbon is a major component of all organisms living on earth. Autotrophs extract it from the air in the form of carbon dioxide, converting it into organic carbon, while heterotrophs receive carbon by consuming other organisms.

 Because carbon uptake in the terrestrial biosphere is dependent on biotic factors, it follows a diurnal and seasonal cycle. In CO measurements, this feature is apparent in the Keeling curve. It is strongest in the northern hemisphere, because this hemisphere has more land mass than the southern hemisphere and thus more room for ecosystems to absorb and emit carbon.

 Carbon leaves the terrestrial biosphere in several ways and on different time scales. The combustion or respiration of organic carbon releases it rapidly into the atmosphere. It can also be exported into the ocean through rivers or remain sequestered in soils in the form of inert carbon. Carbon stored in soil can remain there for up to thousands of years before being washed into rivers by erosion or released into the atmosphere through soil respiration. Between1989 and2008 soil respiration increased by about0.1% per year. In2008, the global total of CO released from the soil reached roughly98 billion tonnes, about10 times more carbon than humans are now putting into the atmosphere each year by burning fossil fuel. There are a few plausible explanations for this trend, but the most likely explanation is that increasing temperatures have increased rates of decomposition of soil organic matter, which has increased the flow of CO. The length of carbon sequestering in soil is dependent on local climatic conditions and thus changes in the course of climate change. From pre-industrial era to2010, the terrestrial biosphere represented a net source of atmospheric CO prior to1940, switching subsequently to a net sink.

 Ocean( edit)

 Main article: Oceanic carbon cycle The ocean contains the greatest quantity of actively cycled carbon in this world and are second only to the lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store. Its surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved inorganic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon( DIC) is about15% higher than that of the surface layer. DIC is stored in the deep layer for much longer periods of time. Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.

 Carbon enters the ocean mainly through the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is converted into carbonate. It can also enter the ocean through rivers as dissolved organic carbon. It is converted by organisms into organic carbon through photosynthesis and can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the ocean's deeper, more carbon rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells as calcium carbonate. It circulates in this layer for long periods of time before either being deposited as sediment or, eventually, returned to the surface waters through thermohaline circulation.

 Oceanic absorption of CO is one of the most important forms of carbon sequestering limiting the human- caused rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, this process is limited by a number of factors. Because the rate of CO dissolution in the ocean is dependent on the weathering of rocks and this process takes place slower than current rates of human greenhouse gas emissions, ocean CO uptake will decrease in the future. CO absorption also makes water more acidic, which affects ocean biosystems. The projected rate of increasing oceanic acidity could slow the biological precipitation of calcium carbonates, thus decreasing the ocean's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide.

 Earth's interior( edit)

 The geologic component of the carbon cycle operates slowly in comparison to the other parts of the global carbon cycle. It is one of the most important determinants of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus of global temperatures.

 Most of the earth's carbon is stored inertly in the earth's lithosphere. Much of the carbon stored in the earth's mantle was stored there when the earth formed. Some of it was deposited in the form of organic carbon from the biosphere. Of the carbon stored in the geosphere, about80% is limestone and its derivatives, which form from the sedimentation of calcium carbonate stored in the shells of marine organisms. The remaining20% is stored as kerogens formed through the sedimentation and burial of terrestrial organisms under high heat and pressure. Organic carbon stored in the geosphere can remain there for millions of years.

 Carbon can leave the geosphere in several ways. Carbon dioxide is released during the metamorphosis of carbonate rocks when they are subducted into the earth's mantle. This carbon dioxide can be released into the atmosphere and ocean through volcanoes and hotspots. It can also be removed by humans through the direct extraction of kerogens in the form of fossil fuels. After extraction, fossil fuels are burned to release energy, thus emitting the carbon they store into the atmosphere.

 Human influence( edit)

 Main article: Global warming Human activity since the industrial era has changed the balance in the natural carbon cycle. Units are in gigatons. CO in Earth's atmosphere if half of global- warming emissions are not absorbed.( NASA computer simulation). Since the industrial revolution, human activity has modified the carbon cycle by changing its components' functions and directly adding carbon to the atmosphere.

 The largest human impact on the carbon cycle is through direct emissions from burning fossil fuels, which transfers carbon from the geosphere into the atmosphere. The rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land- use, particularly deforestation.

 Another direct human impact on the carbon cycle is the chemical process of calcination of limestone for clinker production, which releases CO. Clinker is an industrial precursor of cement.

 Humans also influence the carbon cycle indirectly by changing the terrestrial and oceanic biosphere. Over the past several centuries, direct and indirect human- caused land use and land cover change( LUCC) has led to the loss of biodiversity, which lowers ecosystems' resilience to environmental stresses and decreases their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. More directly, it often leads to the release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere. Deforestation for agricultural purposes removes forests, which hold large amounts of carbon, and replaces them, generally with agricultural or urban areas. Both of these replacement land cover types store comparatively small amounts of carbon, so that the net product of the process is that more carbon stays in the atmosphere.

 Other human- caused changes to the environment change ecosystems' productivity and their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Air pollution, for example, damages plants and soils, while many agricultural and land use practices lead to higher erosion rates, washing carbon out of soils and decreasing plant productivity.

 Humans also affect the oceanic carbon cycle. Current trends in climate change lead to higher ocean temperatures, thus modifying ecosystems. Also, acid rain and polluted runoff from agriculture and industry change the ocean's chemical composition. Such changes can have dramatic effects on highly sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs, thus limiting the ocean's ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere on a regional scale and reducing oceanic biodiversity globally.

 Arctic methane emissions indirectly caused by anthropogenic global warming also affect the carbon cycle, and contribute to further warming in what is known as climate change feedback.

 On12 November2015, NASA scientists reported that human- made carbon dioxide( CO) continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years: currently, about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels remains in the atmosphere and is not absorbed by vegetation and the ocean.
